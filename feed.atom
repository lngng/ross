        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm travelling to Vietnam soon, 2-3 days in HCMC, a few days on Phu Quoc island, a lot of time in Tan Chau.
 I'm very into tea and was hoping to find some tea shops that sell good quality loose leaf teas in HCMC and/or Tan Chau. As far as HCMC goes, I'll be in District 1 and District 3, with my tight schedule I won't be able to leave these areas in HCMC. 
 Any tips? I've found a few on google that look potentially promising (such as Trà Việt), but I wanted to know if there were better shops that I'm probably missing since I don't speak the language, or just some place that's a hidden gem. 
 Second, would tea be an appropriate gift for someone's family in Vietnam? We have other gifts we're bringing (Family member is getting married), but I thought I might add to it with a set of nicely presented teas as a thank you for hosting us.
 ​
 Thanks for any help!

        <updated>2023-02-11T17:27:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, ChatGPT is becoming a hot topic in Vietnam because of how accessible it is to normal users and follow that trend is a booming scam market regarding to create a ChatGPT account. Because of that, I decided to make a post to guide you how to create your own legitimate ChatGPT account.
 Dạo gần đây, ChatGPT đã trở thành chủ đề nóng được quan tâm ở Việt Nam vì dịch vụ dễ dàng tiếp cận đối với người dùng bình thường, chính vì sự bùng nổ đó kéo theo vấn nạn lừa đảo liên quan đến việc tạo tài khoản ChatGPT. Chính vì thế mình quyết định viết bài post hướng dẫn tạo tài khoản ChatGPT chính gốc của bạn.
 ​
  
Because ChatGPT is not supported in Vietnam, you need a VPN to change your IP to another country. In case you don't have a VPN, vn-z forum provided a lot of vpn account for you to choose. Bởi vì ChatGPT không hỗ trợ ở Việt Nam, bạn sẽ cần VPN để chuyển địa chỉ IP của bạn sang nước khác. Trong trường hợp bạn không có VPN, diễn đàn vn-z có cung cấp tài khoản VPN cho các bạn thoải mái sử dụng.
 You need a foreign phone number for verification, I recommended smspool because it is reliable, cheap (depends on the country, most likely cost less than 1$) and I used it for my ChatGPT account myself. Các bạn cũng sẽ cần đến số điện thoại nước ngoài để xác minh danh tính, mình khuyến khích các bạn dùng smspool vì nó ổn định, rẻ (tuỳ đất nước bạn chọn, giá thành sẽ thấp hơn 20,000đ).
  
Good luck/Chúc may mắn
 Edit: ChatGPT is now supporting in Vietnam (11/2/2023), however you will need ChatGPT Plus for 20$. Depends on your need, my guide will be cheaper for you. Để tạo tài khoản ChatGPT ở Việt Nam tại thời điểm hiện tại, bạn cần đăng kí ChatGPT Plus với giá 20$ (470,000đ). Tuỳ nhu cầu sử dụng mỗi người, người dùng phổ thông không có 400,000đ dư giả để tiêu thì cách trên mình hướng dẫn rẻ hơn.

 In two weeks I will be accompanying my wife and our daughter on a short term business trip to Hanoi. Probably three months with short side trips to HCMC.
 What kind of weather can I expect?
 Is it jeans and hoodie or shorts and t-shirt?
 I've been to Vietnam a few times, but never in the north in winter/spring. So I usually pack t-shirts, shorts, light trekking pants and light trekking shirts.
 I'm a pretty big guy from the Netherlands and have no problems with cold, but heat gets to me quickly.
 Thanks a lot!

I went to their website but could not find any information. I contacted them but have still not received a response. I would prefer to climb there without a guide, as I have all the stuff, but I wasn't sure if I was allowed. It seems strange that it is right in the middle of the main pathway. Can anyone lend any insight into this? Thanks!

For those who don't know, Li Xi is a popular celebration in Vietnamese culture, but not many people know about the darker aspects of its history. This video delves into that history and provides a new perspective on this important celebration. I think it's an interesting and eye-opening watch, and I hope you all find it as educational as I did. Check it out and let me know what you think!

Starting in the north amd making my way down. When im further south so of may family are joining me and im looking for somewhere amazing for them to stay. Id love it to be an island, ive been looking at a lot about phu quoc, but ive heard and seen stories about it being super touristy, a lot of building work going on and a lot of rubbish on some of the beaches. Is this true? Are there any other island or costal places you would recommend that are nicer with beautiful beaches and scenery. Any help would be amazing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm planning on relocating to Ho Chi Minh City in the near future, and am having trouble finding information online regarding the availability and costs of psychiatric help in the city. Right now I am on two psychiatric medications. While it appears it would not be too difficult to purchase these medications from pharmacies, I would like to have someone in the city who can monitor the effects of the medication, ideally on a monthly basis. 
 Are psychiatrists who have a good grasp of English hard to find in Vietnam? 
 How much would a visit generally cost? 
 Would going to a private hospital monthly to be evaluated be a feasible alternative? 
 I've read about issues with 'fake' versions of medications; is there a way to ensure I can avoid these? 
 Any additional insights would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I’m going to be in Can Tho for some days and I want to photograph along the river. I’m looking for a translator so I can speak to locals. The only requirement would be to be speak Vietnamese, English and to be an open and communicative person. 
 Any hints are appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just got a 5 years Visa Exemption because my parents were born in Vietnam, then I asked in the embassy what am I allowed to do there with this Visa and if can work..etc, she basically said "you can do whatever you want, just remember to leave the country after 180 days". 
 -Is this true? Am I allowed to work there? Can I extend the 180 days limit for another 180 days without leaving the country?
 -Any other app to find a place to stay besides Agoda, Booking, Airbnb...?
 -Any recommendations for a good Vietnamese teacher/school for beginners?
 What should I do/know/prepare or whatever before going to live in Hanoi from 15 March to 15 June?
 Any information you would like to share will be really appreciate it!
 Thank you and sorry, English is not my main language.

 Good idea? Anyone done this? By the look of travel vlogs it's what backpackers do in the north, in the mountains, but is is common in the city? 
 Pls share any experience with this. Thanks x

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am 27 and finishing up a degree in the next 6 months to get my CELTA and hopefully teach in either Vietnam or Taiwan. This is something I've wanted since I was a teenager and I will be 28 by the time this becomes possible. My motivations beyond teaching English is to learn the language, however difficult Vietnamese may prove.
 I have been debating between Taiwan or Vietnam for years and have considered as many factors as possible, but one I would like some insight on is how difficult it may prove to form friendships with locals. I do not expect anyone to be enamored by foreigners and I am not looking for super deep friendships. I am not looking for a best friend and I am not looking for a significant other. I don't expect to be grabbing dinner or drinks constantly with locals. But I do want to be friends with locals and not solely rely on other expats.
 How realistic is this in Vietnam? I understand given my age where most people will be raising families and the language/cultural differences, that it will prove to be difficult. But once I get a working grasp of Vietnamese (however long and difficult that may be), could I expect to create some friendships with people besides other expats? From what I've read, this may be easier in Vietnam vs Taiwan, and I was looking for insight. I consider myself very friendly and I am always eager to make new friends, so normally this is not difficult for me but I have no previous experience to Vietnam nor living in a country where English is not the first language.

A friend of mine said that recently, staff at Phạm Ngũ Lão bus station told him the bus to Moc Bai doesn't run any more, and to either take a private taxi or book a bus to Phnom Penh and then just get off at the border (which is obviously a lot more expensive).
 ​
 Google still shows it as an active bus route though. Can anyone confirm?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'll fly into Da Nang tomorrow from Malaysia. I'm a non-stop traveller, therefore I always bring all my belongings of which my drone is part of. I know that bringing a drone into the country is legal, however flying without permission is not and I reached out to so many officials in Vietnam and my local Vietnamese embassy to apply - without luck of course.
 By now, I couldn't care less about not being able to fly without a permit, but I'm worried about importing the thing via Da Nang, an airport that's notoriously famous for its customs officers' outdated mindset, with them confiscating drones. Obviously I want to avoid that and so I'm asking if anyone has made any recent experiences there and if it's still true that they only scan carry-on, but not checked bags?

 When I was in Vietnam, I was having fun but also stressed at the same time. There were too much people and traffic. As an introvert, I don’t like when it’s overcrowded. The weather was also too hot for my taste. I was also worried about getting pickpocketed, but luckily nothing happened.
 I told my mom several times that I wanted to go home. And I was so happy when it was finally time to travel back home. But now after returning, I suddenly feel depressed. I suddenly miss my relatives and all the adventures we did. I miss the food and culture also. 
 I told myself that this would be the third and final time I’m travelling to Vietnam, but now I’m itching to go back in the future. Does anyone else feel the same after their trip?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is not a critique of the country or the culture, just a curiosity question.
 I have a couple of female friends who over the past year who told me they are going to get married. 
 One of them told me that her parents are close with the parents of the the impending husband, and that her parents have wanted her to marry the guy for a while. 
 The other is being told by her parents she has to leave Vietnam and go and marry someone in Europe. Its a bit of a match making thing through friends of the family, even though she isn't that keen on going. 
 There was another very similar story I came across too this week via a friend's friend.
 Is this common? For the parents to essentially choose (or have an extremely strong preference) for who the girl should marry? I always thought this was more an Indian/South Asian thing.

 Is this a change in policy with all banks or only these two?

 It was one of if not the greatest month of my life even if by week three it felt like I was being chased by COVID.
 A lot of sites we had planned to visit didn't happen since most places shut down. At the time we had no idea of the future and really thought we would just visit the following year. Not knowing the world would be shut down. 
 It's almost three years later and has life really changed. I'm a home owner now, have a daughter who is 14 months and a son on the way. 
 Life has become very adulty. 😂 
 Traveling with my wife will never be the same but we always talk about our time in Vietnam.
 It's beautiful, the country is appasulty beautiful! The people are appasulty beautiful! We made such great friends on our trip even with the language barrier. Friends who we still keep in touch with till this day. 
 I know we'll be back one day most likely when we're old. Going to have to skip out on the sleep buses and over night train rides at the point. 😆
 I hope we can visit much sooner than later with or without the kids. I would love to bring my children with me, I want them to be as well traveled as myself.
 I really just wanted to let everyone know how much I miss and love Vietnam and hope to see everyone sooner than later. 
 Ps. I still have yet to find Cao Lau in the states.

 Any Saigon shops that ship to Da Nang would be cool too.
 I live in Texas and there aren’t any good shops here, except for in Houston, but I’m not too into their designs either.

1h flight direct / 3h with layover.
 But I’ve heard there is almost always delays with domestic flights here especially with budget airlines. 
 
11h bus ride. Already done 8 hour Saigon to Da Lat & doing 4 hour Da Lat to Nha Trang tomorrow. 
 
11h train. Not heard much. 
 
 What’s the locals option on doing this? What would be my best option we are with a group of 6. Money isn’t the biggest concern but should be considered. Time definitely more valuable as we are moving place to place every 3 days roughly.

 I have recently been offered a management job to join a company in Vietnam. The salary they are offering would be 85 million đồng per month plus minor stock options in the business. 
 I current live in the UK (but not in London) and earn around 15% more than this but I believe even living in HCMC, my living expenses in Vietnam would be much less than what I have now.
 Obviously I know that the average person in Vietnam is not earning 85 million / month, but will this be enough for a foreigner to rent a city centre apartment, get a motorbike (or even car?) and live comfortably?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chào các bạn!
 So after being very confused why my Vietnamese friend was saying words that end in “oc” as “op,” I decided to do some research. Apparently, in Vietnamese, you have to close your mouth for certain ending constants, so a word ending in ung would sound like “ungm.”
 My question to you guys is how say it. I remember teaching my friends how to properly pronounce the Spanish “t” by placing the tips of their tongues on the top part of the back of their teeth. I realize this question is kind of technical, but everything I’ve looked up doesn’t really address it or attributes it to an different accent or dialect (but both Northerners and Southerners do this from my knowledge).
 Any advice? Many thanks! Cảm ơn!
 I also tagged this as discussion since I can’t seem to get a clear answer on how to do this lingual maneuver.

I'm looking for any Vietnamese sources relating to this (that are either digitised or could be sent to me online, as I am carrying out this research in the UK). There's one in particular I'd love to know more about: Mai dam: Mot te doan? nghe nghiep? Hinh thuc no le? (apologies for lack of tone marks I don't have the keyboard on this laptop) 
 Alternatively, if any body knows anyone who might be willing to do an oral interview with me on this sensitive topic, that would be extremely helpful. Please feel free to reach out via message!

 My fiance and I (US) are getting married this year and are doing a reception in the U.S. and in Viet Nam with my side of the family who are in Viet Nam. It will be a small affair, of about 25-30 people max, total. Does anyone know of any venues in Saigon that could host this, and/or estimates as to how much an event like this my cost? I read some anecdotes of a low key reception of 50 people costing $1k that included food, MC, music. 
 Honestly any information or experience or advice you would have would be so helpful and much appreciated. I don't even know where to start looking, lol. Cảm ơn nhiều!

 That said last week an old geezer rear ended my PCX on his 25 year old Wave, or whatever it was.
 Pretty sure he'd been at the Bia Hoi, and 99% sure his vision wasn't 20/20. Add in that it happened at night.
 It's said that Thailand is the second most dangerous country in the world re. traffic accidents and fatalities.
 Where does Vietnam fit into the picture re. the aforementioned?
 I drive really slowly, be it in the city or on the bigger roads. Seems that's the key. A colleague said to me he treats everyone as a drunk driver looking at their phone.
 Then you have the buffalo boys who hoon around town, helmetless. Surely these guys don't last long?
 Interested in what you've seen/been involved in/heard re. the madness that is Vietnamese traffic.
 *Note: not shitting on Vietnam, just want some feedback. For me, traffic and dodgy bosses are the least pleasant aspect of living here. They are balanced out, or outweighed by the positives.

 I'm looking to see if there are laid back, cheap beer, cheap simple mixed drinks, beach bars, not clubs, I don't want DJs or raves or anything like that and are they in close proximity to the main resorts?
 I love sitting feet in the sand having a local beer with good conversation.

Then suddenly a vietnamese older guy walked into the restaurant and just come up to us and started talking. I could not make out what he was saying. he mumbled a lot to the point I wasn't sure if he was even vietnamese. I am vietnamese so i would be able to understand if he wanted something from us. But he especially looked at my husband and told me something. Then he sat down next to us on the other table and kept on talking to us. Finally I can hear what he was saying and he kept mumbling how my husband has to learn vietnamese to communicate. He had this painful, almost angry expression on his face. He seems offended my husband doesn't speak vietnamese somehow. 
 The staff finally came over and asked him to leave. She was alone so she didn't know how to handle the situation. I asked her about him and she said he seems drunk and not from around the neighborhood. 
 Does this happened to any of you? didn't know how to react, was uncomfortable during and after it. he stayed for at least 10mins just talk and talk and talk... so very weird

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi:
 I'm seeing a lady that mentioned she loves Vietnamese Fish Sauce. We're both Americans living in Northern California. 
 I'd like to surprise her. Some (I'm sorry, very, very basic) questions.
 - Is there a good fish sauce flavored snack like chips or crackers I could find for her? I'm in Northern California and there are Vietnamese (or at least large Asian) supermarkets. 
 - If I bought her a bottle of fish sauce for her kitchen is there anything likely to be in an American kitchen she could pair it with? Any brands you'd suggest? Is fish sauce something you pretty much need to make yourself?
 - If I stop by a local Vietnamese restaurant, what could I order (and it wouldn't surprise if the answer is 'anything') that would have a lot of fish sauce? Spring rolls?
 ​
 Any help is appreciated!!!
 cảm ơn (looked it up!)

 So I'm planning a trip to SE Asia in a few months, and was wondering what the situation is like for public restrooms in Vietnam? It's been over 20ish years since I last came to VN and I don't remember what it was like then (was visiting friends and their families, and we were mostly in rural areas).
 Now that I'm older and a little more sensitive in terms of food, I'm concerned with eating something that won't sit well and I'll need to run to the bathroom or something.
 I'm already planning to pack things like napkins, antibiotics, anti-diarrheals, and other stomach whatever medicine, but just wanted to hear from others what to expect!
 For reference, going to Saigon and Ha Noi for this trip. They're big tourist cities, so I'm assuming it shouldn't be a big issue but I understand I shouldn't assume.

Ironically the label says "Made in Vietnam" but I had never seen anything like this before and all my attempts to look for one here haven't been successful yet. What I want to look for:
  
Same material. After wearing these I can't go back to jeans anymore!
 
The zip convertible is convenient in rainy season.
 
The attached belt and lots of pockets.
 
I'm a bit big (bellied 😣) for Vietnamese, usually I wear Vietnamese 3XL or Canadian M-L. It's a bit difficult to find big sizes here.
 
 I can buy in HCMC or order online. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The other night my partner and I were having dinner on P. Mã Mây in Hanoi when two local dudes starting attacking another local dude. Large machetes, axes, and sword like instruments were produced. The parties started swinging them at each other. We were a bit taken back because of the time, only 07:00pm, and it was in a semi busy tourist area. It was literally across from a very popular tattoo place. 
 My partner and I got out of there pretty quick smart, but we’re pretty surprised/shocked that this kind of thing happened in a popular street. While both of us have witnessed this kind of violence in our home country (aus), we just weren’t sure what the normal thing to do in Hanoi would be? In Australia, the incident would have incited loads of media and police attention/investigation.
 We kinda just played the ‘eyes shut’ game and didn’t tell anyone about it.
 Should we have reported the incident to local police? Is this a normal thing to happen in Hanoi and is it just underreported to tourists?

Đó là chuyện mặc 🩲, tôi không biết làm cách nào mà các bạn có thể mặc nó mà không bị cộm lên. Của tôi không phải là to quá nhưng mặc vào nó cứ cộm lên trông ngại lắm luôn, nhất là lúc đến trường á. Mặc quần tây của đồng phục trường mình mà nó cộm lên rõ luôn, sợ nhất là bị các bạn nữ nhìn👀. Có ông nào biết cách chỉ tôi nha! Chứ giờ không biết sao, mặc như không mặc, cộm lên như lúc thả rông luôn🥲.

 I was curious to know if Mahashivratri is also celebrated there in Vietnam?

And because of the past you know that stuff will never go away. More recently exceptionalism has manifested through promotion of cultural aspects. Best food, best scenery, friendliest people ! Humble my ass. Why learn about any other culture or move anywhere right ? Vietnam's the place to be type shit. Most people just love the country, they dont think we're the chosen people or anything, it's more so the attitude online and the media sometimes that bug tf out of me

I just came back from Vietnam, and a lot of locals told me that my Vietnamese is correct, but that they know I am a foreigner because my way of speaking sounds "lớ lớ."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am quite worried. Please help.
 I’m a dual-citizen: Armenian and American. I arrived into Laos today from Thailand with my Armenian passport and I had a visa for it. The border patrol rejected my entry because they wanted me to get into Laos using my American passport given that I got Thai entry/exit stamps in that passport. So I had to reapply with a visa on arrival using my American passport. This caught me by surprise because I’ve switched my passport several times while visiting countries and it has never been a problem.
 AND I’m going to Vietnam in 2 days and I have a visa approval for Vietnam under my Armenian passport again. A worker at Laos’ immigration said it’s fine if I enter Vietnam and that the rules are different but I want to be sure. Vietnamese consulates in Laos are closed for the weekend and I can’t get help from anyone. Does anyone have more information about this? Does Vietnam allow passport swapping?
 Note: there’s no visa on arrival for Armenians or Americans.

 Id say he’s the Kendrick Lamar /Jcole for Vietnam in terms of rappers but open to suggestion to see if there’s anyone better.

 - Is there a nightlife?
 - Are there many gyms? I wanted to look into learning mixed martial arts...any options there?

 Overall, what should I expect? Thanks!

The people were great, everyone had a huge "togetherness" spirit when COVID started.. Now.... I absolutely hate it. Everyone, every day, is trying to screw each other over. Old people are vile and rude as fuck, acting like a bunch of gorillas. Everyone has an agenda. Companies are dishonest. People try to kill you on the road and act cowardly when confronted. When I came here, I was on TV talking about how great Vietnam is, but I've never in my life been tricked, lied to or screwed over as much as here. I am deeply depressed and miserable. HOWEVER, I am trying to reconnect with the reasons why I loved this place. One last ditch effort to regain happiness here.. maybe some of you can help me re-ignite that spark again. What is it that you like about living here? EDIT: I've been here 3 years

On the embassy website it states that you will need an appointment to be seen, but I have heard that it is also possible to be seen as a walk-in. Does anyone have any experience of this? An alternative option for me would be to send my documents to the embassy by post, but I would prefer to do the process in person if possible.

Her employer said she will be assigned which center to work at based on where she lives. So im looking for an apartment or room (with her own kitchen and good enough privacy) in the southern half of the city. If the location is near centers in Phú Lâm, Bình Tân, Hùng Vương, Him Lam, Nguyễn Cư Trinh or Phú Mỹ Hưng thatd be ideal. Her budget is 12 million per month and that hopefully covers everything she needs to worry about rent-wise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do not think the news was already posted here, but the Michelin Guide is coming in Vietnam. First edition of the guide will be released in June.
 I think it’s a great think for Vietnam – It will help a lot the restaurants aiming to offer fine dining especially Vietnamese ones.
 What are your prognostics about the potential decorated restaurant in Vietnam?
 My opinion:
 - No 3 Stars Restaurants. I really do not think any venue in Vietnam is there yet. Bangkok does not have any 3 Stars Restaurants.
 - Anan Saigon: I really see them decorated. I tried them few years ago it was great, but it seems what they offer now is more elaborated. It’s the only restaurant in Vietnam that made to Asia’s Top 50 + their food relates a lot to Vietnam
 - I also think that the Guide will give one Star to a good Street food stall / place either in Ha Noi or HCMC. The guide did that both in Thailand (Jay bee) and Singapore. It’s a way for them to not appear too snobbish and it’s good PR…
 - Maybe one or two high end French Restaurants from Ho Chi Minh City: I have tried 3 Gourmands / La Villa / P’tit Saigon / Le Corto. All of them are great but I guess inspectors of the guide have been eating a lot in “similar” restaurants. I am just not sure if they will be "good enough" to get one Stars with French Cuisine. I could also add La Badiane in Ha Noi to this list.
 - One or more Japanese Restaurant? Likely – There is so many great Japanese Restaurant both in Hanoi et HCMC. I have just not tried enough of them to have an any name in mind.
 For the locals not familiar with how the Guide works ( I have seen many mistakes both on Facebook and local news sites) we wrote this article: https://amthuchiendai.vn/tat-ca-nhung-gi-can-biet-ve-cam-nang-michelin/

Looking to get some suits made, maybe a sweater and a coat too as well as shirts and trousers. Have heard that Hoi An is a bit of a tourist trap in this regard and wondering if there are better tailors for the same price in the other cities. Looking to spend between $150-$250 USD for suits. Anyone got any recommendations/tips? Cheers!

 We want to spend some days in Hanoi and then visit other places.

 Any recommended Ha Long Bay cruise companies? Im looking for luxury cruises. No budget. I already looked into Genesis and Athena. Please let me know your experiences.
 Is it recommended to stay in Cat Ba for a few nights? or Ha Long? or Hanoi? I plan to do a 2 night cruise starting my second day, so ill have 2 nights to burn. I'm looking to do some exploring but mostly want to relax. Ill most likely be flying out of Hanoi.
 Thanks for any/all advice given!

 To put it simply, I am currently filing taxes for 2022 and it asks for my marital status in which I understand that I should put Married but am unsure which type of Married filing I should put, whether separately, jointly or head of household.
 I am also working on papers to bring my wife to the US, so I don't know if picking one of these choices is more beneficial than the other. Although, I do know that filing jointly is much more difficult and may take time to obtain certain papers.
 She does not have an income if that matters.

 A local internet service provider reported Monday that the Intra Asia (IA) cable has been encountering problems since last Saturday. There was a breakage at a cable section located about 130 km from a shoreline station in Singapore, causing a total loss of international data from Vietnam to Singapore through the IA cable.
 The latest breakage means that only one undersea cable connecting Vietnam globally, the SMW3, remains fully functional.
 Vietnam is currently connected with seven undersea cables: SMW3, AAG, IA, APG, AAE-1, SJC2 and ADC. Besides the recent breakage of the IA, problems with the AAE, AAG and APG cables tha…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I booked a round trip to Bai Chay/ Ha Long bay for one day (10.30AM- 18.30 PM) and I wanted to simply enjoy a nice view and possibly hike in a quiet place (hence the idea to spend most of the time in Cat Ba). Would I miss much by only doing that? I would be happy to do a 1/2 hrs boat tour in the bay, but all I see are expensive cruises taking a lot of time-or you know some? Any advice/link appreciated!

  People drink at a Highlands Coffee shop in District 1, Ho Chi Minh City. 
 Y'all can check out more number here: Many Vietnamese spend more on drinks than main meals: report - VnExpress International 
 Another 33% of respondents are willing to spend VND20,000-40,000 on drinks, according to the survey of 3,940 consumers conducted by food and beverage market solutions firm iPOS.
 Only 14% said they would splurge more than VND70,000 for a drink, the equivalent of the price of a drink at high-end coffee shops such as Starbucks and Runam Bistro, it added.
 Nearly 54% of respondents said they visit coffee shops once to twice a month.
 I believe that the avg. hour rate in Vietnam is less than 25,000 VNĐ. How could they spend over 3 hours of working daily for a coffee?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I was wondering whether it would be possible to cycle the Ha Giang Loop? I am planning on heading to Vietnam in the second half of August and am desperate to travel on the Ha Giang Loop but not on a motorbike and also not someone else taking me. I am a very capable cyclist but I was basically wondering if it was possible and safe? I would be happy to make it a large proportion of the trip so if there would be any safer potentially longer routes/roads? And where would be a good place to hire or purchase a good quality bike ( may be cheaper just buying) but would rather hire? I understand this is not the usual way to do the loop but any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks very much

Lived in Thailand for seven years so hanging out on backpacker walking streets the majority of my nights there isnt something I wanna do, I'll go and check it out for a bit but I'm getting a tad bit old for all night drinking sessions with pounding music but I'm also not looking for HiSo speakeasy places where I have to get dressed up lol Oddly specific question I know, was just wondering if there are areas like that, small beer bars with a pool table and the like. Dont really care if there are ladies or not, that's not my objective but if there are it wont bother me either and faux british pubs aren't really my thing either lol. Thanks for any suggestions

 I'm Vietnamese-American (28F) and have visited my family in Việt Nam several times. But, the last time I visited was in 2016. My husband and I are planning a long vacation in Việt Nam late summer this year and I was wondering what street fashion for young adults in their 20s is like now, for both men and women. My husband is white so he's going to stand out no matter what, so I'm not worried about looking like I am a "local", but am really just interested in how street fashion has changed since I last visited and what is commonplace now. 
 In college, I met an exchange student from Việt Nam and when he saw me wearing short running shorts, he was appalled and asked why I was wearing those. I was confused why he was so shocked and he said in Việt Nam, only prostitutes wear shorts that short (they were like...mid-thigh length). This was back in 2014, though... I have no idea how accurate that reaction was to what's commonplace though because I've never been there long enough to really notice or outside of my family's district to see much else. 
 Cảm ơn nhiều!

 Hello! 
 Back in December, my airpods were stolen in Da Nang. Since I was flying out the same day, I couldn't do much and went my way. 
 Today, I got a ping on Find My app with the exact address. They are in Phuoc Ninh, Hai Châu, Da Nang. 
 What are my options to recover them? Would the police take this seriously? 
 They were my first gift to my would be fiance, so the emotional value matters a lot more than the financial value.

 Last year I went to Thailand and the subreddit r/Thailandtourism helped me a lot because I could look I could look up a lot of stuff and ask questions. It seems like there is no equivalent subreddit for traveling Vietnam, is there a site which a lot of people use that I just don't know of? Or is traveling through Vietnam that much rarer and information is not sought after?
 It feels like I just don't know a very obvious site/forum...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Need help choosing which Ha Giang Loop tour to take!
 Planning to do a 3/4 day Ha Giang Loop tour with an easy rider (can’t ride a motorbike, and honestly some parts of the route looks hella dangerous for someone w no experience). Saw lots of different tour groups, and most of them (Jasmine Hostel, Ha Giang Road Trip, QTmotors) seem to have pretty good reviews, making it kind of hard to choose between them. Could someone recommend me a suitable one based on these criteria?
 (1) Can arrange for transport back and forth from Hanoi (2) Experienced, heavy focus on safety (3) Really just a personal preference, but would prefer one with less of a ‘party’ vibe. Saw lots of videos with HUGE groups that are kind of loud and wild at night, and honestly I’d just like one with more of a chill vibe/ a smaller group (4) I don’t mind spending more, but lower prices would be great!
 Also, is there a big difference in the weather in end April and middle of May? 
 Thank you in advance!
 Edit: I’ll be doing this in End April/May :) do PM me if you’re planning to go there too!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for insights on the following;
 I am considering to move from Europe to HCM with my GF(Vietnamese). I've visited the city few times and absolutely love it. However, I would like to know how is the worklife in Vietnam (e.g. working style, hours)? Obviously companies are not the same - is there a large difference when working in a Western company and local?
 My concern comes from previous experience, when I was working in a Chinese company, and did not find the working style to be suitable for me. I felt that there was not enough freedom to conduct work within the strict corporate hierarchy. Also, had too much unnecessary work (internal processes), which requires constant overtime. Are Chinese and Vietnamese working styles similar or different?
 I'm currently working in senior management, and I'm not able to speak Vietnamese.
 All comments highly appreciated!
 Tldr: planning to move to Vietnam, would like to know more about the worklife

I went to Vietnam on a tourist visa, however, the process is long and arduous. As I read on the Vietnamese Embassy in Canada’s website, a child of Vietnamese citizens could get exempt from a visa. However, as my parents both have Canadian passports, I don’t think this is feasible, but would ask if in any way I could be exempt from a visa or maybe claim Vietnamese citizenship from my parents. Thank you!

Usually when you go to the more diverse provinces (Lào Cai, Hà Giang, ...), the hotels are all run by Kinh people. I once asked a hotelier in Sapa about this and he said 'they [referring to Hmong/Dao] don't know how to run businesses', which was amusingly direct.
 Anyway, any good recommendations in scenic areas in the far North? I would love to fall asleep to the sound of a different language (Hmong, Dao, Tày, anything really) being spoken by the proprietor's family. Many thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I'm from Malaysia, I just got back from Vietnam, Saigon, few days ago during Chinese New Year, it was my first time being in Vietnam.
 The people there were super friendly, compare to the other neighbouring SEA countries, I would dare say THE MOST friendly and interactive people, I actually felt welcomed. Food was amazing, the street food blew my mind, I ate banh mi twice a day, daily and never got sick of it. Never got to try pho but I had bun bo hue and others which I don't knkw what it was, I just pointed the picture, nod and bow a little cause I felt bad that I couldn't speak Vietnamese.
 My mistake was not knowing that Vietnamese was celebrating Lunar New Year and most shops were closed for 3 to 4 days and we didnt get to see, eat most of the food we wanted to try, experience the culture, went to vung tau on the 4th day instead, wrong choice I would say because I think the locals went there for holiday or went back to their hometown, that's my assumption, so the traffic was pretty heavy but it was a fun.
 I should have gone there on the 5th day of Lunar New Year/Chinese New Year but all and all, it was an amazing place, fell in love with Vietnam just like how I fell in love with Japan when I first visited it, Extremely friendly, yes I can't express enough the friendliness of the Vietnamese
 My next trip is to visit Hanoi, any recommendations of place to visit? Food to try or anything that the locals usually enjoy
 Thank you, from your neighbour, Malaysia

I will be travelling for the very first time to Hanoi and i am planning to get an apartment there for a whole month, but I am very undecided about where to stay. I don't drive and usually walk everywhere, I've been told I should stay in Tay Ho and it looks great for walking, but I am also wondering whether for a first trip it would be better to stay in Old Quarter? As I would like to also have access to the buses / trains to do trips to Halong Bay / Sapa etc.
 I've actually eyed an apartment which is exactly in between Tay Ho and Old Quarter, near the Tran Quoc Pagoda. Google Maps says it's a 25-30 minutes walk in either direction which i normally would not mind at all, but I've heard horror stories about the traffic in Hanoi so I am wondering whether this is doable or not?

 When I met my wife she was a sweet, cute, self conscious and family oriented person which i fell in love with. After we got our son 5 years ago we had a rough time for a couple of years. I needed to work too much to provide for us and she had the burden of taking care of the kid most of the time. In my opinion she fell into depression during that time which i was unable to recognize. Corona was the cherry on the top and didn't help either.

 I really enjoy coffee and have been in Vietnam for almost a month now. I've noticed that when I order a Den / Black Coffee (no sugar, no additives) it usually comes with a cup of water (sometimes hot water).
 Is there a reason for this? Am I supposed to do something with the water such as mixing it or perhaps drinking water first, then drinking the coffee? Just curious. I thank you in advance.

I’m currently working on a translation card so will take that with me. Are there any gluten free ‘on the go’ snacks you know of that I might otherwise avoid for fear of being ‘glutened’ etc… would just love any kind of help really! Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So the last time I actually watched it was 2020 but even before that I did not even pay attention to the show at all. There were way too many ads and the contents were not that good. I understand what they tried to refer to but I don't appreciate them much (mostly because the way they make jokes about events of the year do not solve anything and for me, normalizes all that shits); and yah, I do not find their jokes or "deep".
 BUT, I understand why some like it and that's great for them.
 What I am quite puzzled about is that some would go all the ways to look down on all those who don't like the show. Some would even make remarks and insults others over this.
 So please educate me, is there any thing else about the show that makes it "sacred"? or is it just some people being too close-minded?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everything, I'm thinking of doing the Ha Giang loop on a motorbike in north Vietnam in the next couple of weeks. Originally I was thinking of doing it without a guide, because I want the freedom to explore and maybe do some hiking. However, talking to a few people has made me think it might be better to do it guided, most likely with Jasmine Hostel. Does anyone here have experience with the pros and cons of each? 
 Personally I like the idea of doing it without a guide because I have more freedom to stop and take pictures, explore off the beaten path, do some hiking, and stay longer than 3 nights if I want to. The pros of doing it guided is the social aspect, staying at the best homestays, and the guides knowing the best views and all that. 
 Any feedback or ideas would be appreciated. Thanks I'm advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I figured I'd put this here as it is more of a specialist recipe compared to the scope of a more generalist subreddit like r/cooking, and the Vietnamese food subs are not exactly what could be called active or even semi active. 
 So I have seen various Vietnamese style grilled eel recipes (example: Chargrilled eel in lemongrass and turmeric (luon nuong xa) recipe : SBS Food) that are very much tickling my fancy. I've thought up a cooking method that sounds to me like it would give good results, but it's not something I have ever seen suggested anywhere else so I have no idea whether it would work.
 Specifically, what I am thinking about is pre-cooking the eel before grilling it by poaching in nuoc cham, and then finishing on the grill. What I hope to accomplish with this is: 
 -Getting flavor throughout the eel without having to worry about prematurely denaturing the proteins by using the nuoc cham as the poaching liquid. The lime juice in nuoc cham would do that if the eel was raw, but would not if it was just the cooking liquid because the eel would be cooked before denaturing could happen.
 I also intend to pierce the eel with a fork to get even more flavor throughout, if need be.
 -Setting the stage for a caramelized, crispy finish. The sugars in nuoc cham would be all over the meat and allow for good caramelization.
 As I said though I've never seen this suggested before, so I have troubleshooting questions. Specifically:
 -My primary question: will poaching in nuoc cham make the eel TOO strongly flavored? I like my food a bit more strongly seasoned than most, but as nuoc cham is so strong, I would be cautious about overflavoring here.
 -Would the sugar content end up to more rapid burning than expected when finishing on the grill? I absolutely abhor burnt food so a heads up warning if it is a fine line would be much appreciated.
 Thank you so much and I can't wait to branch out to this area of Vietnam's cuisine!

 She goes by Tam so I’m not sure if the vietnamese passport just had a different given name format from the usual American passport
 My US Passports given name format is First + Middle.. so this is why I’m a little confused.

We've roughly planned to spend 10 - 14 days in Vietnam before heading to phuket (probably flying out of Hanoi). It's only my second ever overseas trip, I just have no idea how to go about it. Out of convenience (we will have suitcases) I've planned to stay roughly a week in Ho Chi Minh, explore the surroundings then fly to Hanoi and stay there roughly a week and explore surroundings. I'm just not sure if this is the right way to go about it, I feel like we would be missing out on a lot of stuff if we are just sticking around the main cities. Would it be better to just spend a few days in Ho Chi Minh then head north a few hours each day by car and stay somewhere new every night or every couple of nights? I'd love any suggestions on some good accomodation, sights to see and just any must do activities while in Vietnam. We love all natural wonders such as mountains, national parks, rivers ect but also want to have some time just exploring and hanging out in the cities and experiencing some night life. Taking all suggestions into consideration and any rough itineraries are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As title says, I may need to hire an attorney and an appraiser to work out my inheritance. I recently posted about assessing the value of a house but after some initial negotiations with the family in Vietnam, I might need legal representation to get the the proper amount that I’m owed by law. 
 My Vietnamese isn’t good so I can’t do a very good job finding and talking to one. Plus I don’t know if there’s an bar association I can use to verify accreditation. 
 Would love to get your thoughts and suggestions. 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chào các bạn /Hello everyone. I’m a US citizen who has recently moved to Vietnam to be with my wife. We met years ago and have been dating for a few years before we got married, and I have finally just dropped everything and moved to Vietnam to be with her. I’m still working on my bachelors degree, but I have a couple years of experience as a professional Vietnamese-English interpreter. I desperately need a job and it has been hard to find something so far. If anyone knows a local job that would work, or even a US based job that I can do remotely, I’d really appreciate it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a Viet Kieu living in Vietnam at the moment, and part of several Facebook groups of women, including single women. I'm seeing more and more women decided to skip matching with white foreigners on dating apps like Bumble. Members in the group share "sexual escapades" by white foreigners in Thailand, which recently tighten their immigration policies, and cause a lot of them to "flee" to other SEA countries like Vietnam. Bald white guys in their 30s are the most obvious skip for these girls, and they are well informed of the LBH that are here on working visas. The language barrier is also another issue they mention, where it's exhausting to use Google translate for every little thing. Many of them share stories of them being coerced into sex by these men, even on first date.
 I'm not really surprised to hear all these stories from Viet girls in both Saigon and Hanoi, and I also translate and share a few of these creeps' posts from reddit on Facebook. Ever since the pandemic Viet people seem to be more wary of white foreigners (they seem more receptive to Koreans and other Asians)
 Of course, some of the more malicious girls like to take these naive foreigners on a wild ride with expensive dates then ditch them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vietnamese American here, I'm doing research on all the different fox spirits across asia and while China, Japan, and Korea's nine tailed foxes seem to have plenty of sources online that I can look at, there's barely any for vietnam's, and my best source thus far for the ho ly tinh has been wikipedia but even its wikipedia page says that it needs more citations and more reliable resources. So I wanted to ask here to see what y'all know about it and preferably if you could also point me in the direction of any sources(preferred is english because I don't know how to read or type vietnamese but I can make do with google translate.) 
 I also wanted to ask how people in vietnam generally view the creature.
 In China and Japan they range from pure evil, to harmless pranksters, to very kind and benevolent beings.
 In Korea, they are seen as purely malevolent creatures
 So I wanted to know how Vietnam generally views them. Do they range from being good to evil? Or are they just evil?
 What powers do they have, generally speaking?
 And the most important one is, how do they get their many tails? Is it just through age? Or do they do something special to get their tails? 
 I've wanted to reconnect with my culture now and I want to do it with my life long passion for mythology. Thank you in advance for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dumb question but I am extremely puzzled. All the toilets here have a bidet for washing ones ass after taking a dump. They are manual bidets - basically a garden hose to spray up ones rectum. However, this can't remove everything cleanly. I've gotten around this by carrying tissues with me and doing a combination of the bidet and paper wipes. Are people just sitting on the toilet and spraying nonstop until everything is cleaned? Are people just walking around with chocolate fudge in their rectums all day? I need to know!

 He escaped after the fall of South Vietnam and is thinking of returning but is afraid of the government sending him to jail or give him a hard time.
 Any advice from all people would be great, thanks.
 Also happy tet!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I moved to Hanoi last summer and honestly I’ve had a terrible experience, I was sexually assaulted in the first week of arriving and I’m still dealing with the police beaurocracy regarding that. Had a breakup of my 2 year relationship, with the person I moved over to Vietnam with and subsequently lost my job due to needing time off to process that. In addition to these personal things, the pollution bothers me and I still haven’t yet mastered driving a motorbike because I had a pretty nasty crash which has put me off for the time being. 
 In my head I’m imagining a move to HCM to be much better, I previously lived in Shanghai and I do prefer the feeling of a big metropolis - but I guess the problems with traffic are even worse there? I’ve struggled to find contemporary art and music events, and it seems like there is more of that type of thing in HCM. 
 Or do I have completely the wrong idea? Should I move somewhere else entirely? I can’t feasibly leave Vietnam for another year because I really need to make back the money I spent on document legalisation etc to get here 
 Thanks for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foreigner here. I go to my wife's hometown pretty often, so for the last four years, I've joined in a lot of celebrations and ran into a lot of the same faces. The "anh"s and "chú"s still really like to drink with me and I'm always sort of a VIP at gatherings despite being more of an introvert and not good in large gatherings.
 My problem: a lot of these guys think it's so fun to ask me what their names are in front of everyone, and more often than not, I don't remember. It's always the same super embarrassing moment when I'm racking my brain to think of this guy's name while everyone is either cringing or laughing at me. And then they tell me their name but because I'm so mortified, I just can't even remember it later even if I make a mental note. My Vietnamese is intermediate, but a lot of these guys in the village have names that I don't know the meanings of, so hard to draw connections...
 This is why gatherings in my wife's hometown are not fun for me. I'm always on edge, and when I sit down around a "mâm", I need to look around and see if there's anyone I don't know or remember and try to listen for their name in conversation. 
 So what should I do to stop looking like such an asshole who can't be bothered to learn people's name and how to better diffuse the situation when it inevitably happens that I don't know a name?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wow... this is probably an impossible question to answer, but we're planning our 2 week trip to Vietnam March 7-21 and after accounting for Hanoi (3ish days), Hoi An (3ish days), Ninh Binh (2ish days), I feel like we can only include 1 of these 'adventure' places to not feel rushed. If you HAD to pick 1 (maaaybe 2) of these experiences, what's your pick?
 3ish days to trek in Sapa
 4 days motorbiking the Ha Giang Loop
 3 days with a guided cave expedition in Phong Nha
 3 days motorbiking/trekking in Dalat
 Some background info: my wife and I are in our late 20's and love combining city life, food, culture, and nature/adventure on our trips. If anything, it's hard for us to 'chill' and slow down while traveling, but we're certainly trying to embody that on this trip more than others :)

With a brief google search I've found that as long as my cat fits in a carry on bag under my seat, has her rabies shot, documents with her history of vaccines, and a vet approved letter she should be able to fly and enter the country with me. 
 I'd love to know if anyone can share their experience travelling with a pet to Vietnam and if I am missing any information. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Please help me (39F and Canadian) do something kind for my Vietnamese immigrant neighbours (late 20s M/F and 3F) for Lunar New Year tomorrow.
 They are such good neighbours! They made me pho when I had surgery and they feed my children homemade spring rolls. One time the Ba Noi was visiting from Vietnam and she made me shrimp in banana leaves but I didn’t know how to eat it. I tried to ask the Ba Noi but she doesn’t speak English so I just tried to take a bite out of the banana leaf. The Ba Noi laughed and laughed and showed me how to unwrap them and eat the shrimp.
 Their little 3F comes over to play with my kids almost every day and we just love her so much. Her parents work so hard — six days a week and long hours. They are such good people and I’m so happy to know them. 
 Anyhow, tomorrow is Lunar New Year and I know they usually have a big party with their Vietnamese friends and set off fireworks. 
 I read that usually you give gifts of money in red envelopes for Lunar New Year. Would that be appropriate for me, their white Canadian neighbour, to bring over tomorrow?
 My two concerns are that I don’t want them to feel that they have to invite me to their party, reciprocate the gift or make them uncomfortable. Also I don’t want to accidentally do something unlucky.
 Thank you Reddit for any advice you can give me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are considering a month summer trip on the Vietnam SE coast. Potentially flying into Denang and spending a week in Hoi An and then maybe flying or night bus/train to Nha Trang and staying there for 3 weeks for relaxing beach time. 
 I’ve read you can’t rent a car in Vietnam and we would not feel comfortable riding scooters with our kid (or even probably just an adult 🤣). 
 The places I’m looking at to stay are not in the city center so we can have more space and a pool. We already live in a high rise in a big SE Asian city, so I’d prefer a villa experience while on vacation. 
 My husband thinks having to use Grab multiple time a day if you want to grocery shop, eat out, visit a different beach will be a huge hassle and the cost will add up. This feels like a dealbreaker to him and he thinks we should scrap the Vietnam idea and go to a different country. :(. I read about hiring a car with driver for a few weeks. This sounds pretty weird to me and maybe awkward, but I figured I need to explore this option.
 How do you find a trusted driver like that? Through your villa rental management staff or is their a reputable company people use? I’ve read about scams where drivers will try to take you to restaurants or tours that give them a commission, which I want to avoid. 
 TIA!

My university has a study abroad program with RMIT Vietnam that I’m interested in and was wondering how good the university is regarding their curriculum and class settings. I’m set to graduate a year early within my degree plan as I’ve earned many college credits during high school and I want to have an opportunity to go out of the States to study abroad during my 3 years in college.
 How are the programs or courses in information technology and computer science there? Most importantly, what’s the outlook like with the tech or CS industry in Vietnam as I’m interested in networking around as well. I’m looking at doing a semester worth of courses, so any insights about university life and studies revolving around the RMIT campus or Vietnam in general are highly appreciated.

 Vegetable Spring rolls look tiny, but somehow I already feel full after eating just a couple. Bánh mì is another one - just half a sandwich and I’m already satisfied. And don’t get me started on the pho or bun bo hue - I think it would take me two full days to finish one bowl
 Back home I could easily devour several slices of pizza and still be hungry, so not sure why Vietnamese food is filling me up so quickly lol

 I applied for visa through them thinking they were government official site (gov.vn) and received the e-visa about a week later. I then asked a question about how my name appears on the e-visa (last,first, middle vs. last, middle,first) and got no response. It’s been a week since. I read the on the embassy website that visas done by third party may not be legit and can result in entrance refusal. Anyone has experience with this site or this kind of service? Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I am planning a trip of about 3/4 weeks in Vietnam and I would like to travel the whole country from north to south (or maybe the other way around).
 Because of work, the only times I can take a full 3 to 4 weeks is either August or end of December/beginning of January around the Christmas holidays. I seem to understand that both these times are not ideal from a weather point of view.
 I have been researching quite a bit and if I got it right it looks like I am going to risk typhoons in the north in August; while December is quite cold in the north and very rainy in the central area of Hue and Hoi An.
 Unfortunately I cannot get around these two times of the year, so I was wondering if you have any suggestions. Maybe some of you have been in August or December and can let me know if it's really risky to the point of having the whole trip ruined by weather?
 I am somewhat tending towards December. Can you enjoy the cruise in Halong Bay at this time or is it too cold and foggy?
 Thanks so much for any tip you may want to give me! :)

 My honest question is though ... Why do so many Vietnamese people make it so hard to learn the language? By this i mean, if I say something wrong in Thai or Khmer, or Italian, I am corrected and helped. In Vietnam, they just give you the "wavy hands" or worse still laugh!
 When Vietnamese speak English to me, much of it is wrong, but I appreciate that they are trying and I "autocorrect" what they said in my head, so as to not embarrass them and then I answer them. The same cannot be said the other way. 
 I really am not meaning to be rude, but why do many Vietnamese (I appreciate it not all) simply try to help me, by autocorrecting and helping me to speak better? 
 Many thanks for all your help!

 Like most leagues and countries there are issues with corruption, greed and self interest. But what really gets me with Vietnam is the MASSIVE potential for the sport, the huge love for the support... but the terrible attendances to league games.
 Sure there are issues with marketing, match fixing, poor kick off times, poor product and more... but I would like to ask the Vietnamese in this group, and those that live here... What are the issues YOU see in Vietnamese football and how would you change them to make things better? Thanks!

 I understand the Catholics, land owners, and capitalists. They would obviously side with Western ideals.
 But it doesn't explain the Buddhist majority, or the majority of people who were not that wealthy. Why did they fight with the U.S. against Ho Chi Minh? Can anyone shed some light on this issue? What were their motivations and beliefs?
 Every time I try to read about this I get the U.S. and International perspective. But I never understand what was happening with the actual Vietnamese people there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow Redditors,
 I am a 47-year-old Belgian man who has had the pleasure of visiting Vietnam 12 times, spending a total of 16 months there. Through my interactions with the South Vietnamese community where I live, as well as my multiple visits and online relationships, I have become fluent in speaking and writing in Vietnamese. In fact, when a native Vietnamese speaker hears me on the phone, they often mistake me for a Vietnamese person. In addition to my fluency in Vietnamese, I also speak French, Dutch and English, and have a basic understanding of German.
 My dream is to find a job in South Vietnam, but I am facing a bit of a hurdle. I have been working for the government since 1996 and therefore do not have any other qualifications beyond my high school diploma. Additionally, I have no concrete proof of the skills and knowledge I have acquired throughout my career. However, I am skilled in working with computers and have strong communication abilities. My current job involves designing templates that are sent to millions of citizens, but the software I use is not utilized by any companies in Vietnam.
 I am willing to accept a salary that is typical for Vietnam, as money is not a concern for me. My only qualifications are my high school diploma and my work experience, so my CV is essentially my career. I am open to any job, but I am unsure of the best course of action. Should I try to find a job while on a tourist visa and do visa runs until I secure employment? Or, should I enroll in a school in Ho Chi Minh City in order to obtain a student visa? I believe my English and Vietnamese language abilities are sufficient to pass any necessary tests, and I am eager to immerse myself in the educational experience.
 All I know is that I am happiest when I am in Vietnam, and I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions on how to make my dream a reality. Thank you for reading and for your responses.

 Growing up in Canada I've never really had the need to say new year wishes in Vietnamese to my other friends here but rather just my grandparents and parents. So I'm used to saying things like chúc mừng năm mới.. or con chúc ông bà nhiều xúc khỏe song lâu tram tuoi etc. 
 So my question is are there any ideas on how I can send her new year wishes without just the plain chúc mừng năm mới? In other words what are some ways to send wishes from friend to friend. 
 From the top of my head in the context of friend to friend, I can only think of wishing for good health, happiness and lots of money. 
 Apologies if this question came out kind of odd or if i'm overthinking it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife and I are visiting VN from March 8-26th. Where we are flying into and out is still in the air depending on the itinerary. I'm a 41 Hue refugee that at 2 months old we escaped from VN to Hong Kong then Philippines then CA, US. I have never been back, and the plan was to visit in 2020 but covid hit. Now is the time. Super excited. Minus traveling days we should have 16 full days.
 Here are the places I wanted to visit: Hanoi, Sapa, Ha Long bay, Ninh Binh, Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An.
 Originally we wanted to fly into Saigon then fly into Da Nang and make our way up north and fly home from Hanoi. However after watching vids on youtube and reading, wondering if we should just skip Saigon and spread say 2 days to the cities mentioned above. Is it worth visiting giving our amount of days in VN? I've heard people say they wouldn't have been sad if they skip it while others say it's a must visit. Also how many days of each cities is sufficient.
 Any suggestions would be helpful. thank you.

 They are in their early 70s and I know he was a soldier in the NVA. Would it be acceptable to bring this topic up in a respectful way and in an appropriate setting (e.g. during a one-on-one conversation while going for a walk, not at the family dinner table)?
 I'm asking because - unsurprisingly - WWII is still a touchy topic in Germany. But these two wars are obviously very different, with Germany being the aggressor and committing genocide. My own grandparents never talkes about WWII, although the topic was still always weirdly present in the background.
 I've done a bit of reading beforehand (Last Night I Dreamed of Peace by Đặng Thùy Trâm, The Sorrow of War by Bảo Ninh, The Peguin History of Modern Vietnam by Christopher Goscha) and watched the Ken Burns documentary about the War, so I wouldn't be totally ignorant and ask dumb/insensitive questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grandfather is name Tuat Van Nguyen born in Hanoi, Vietnam and I believe he grew up in Hanoi, where he was kidnapped on his way to Catholic school. His father was a locksmith. This is all I can gather from him as it is it is a very sensitive topic. We are heading back to Vietnam to search for his parents, or any members of his family, in Saigon and then making our way to Hanoi. I am hoping I can get a head start with some search tips online. It seems the best way to go searching for this would be to look at church records but unfortunately, I need help on the ground. Or any sort of obituary. He seemed to recall one sister. Would it be worth hiring a private investigator? This time we're going back in April. I am his first granddaughter 33 years old and will accompany him.
 Both his grandparents lived in Thai Binh, and he lived there with them before he went to school in Hanoi with his parents.
 His father, Yet Van Nguyen
 Mother, Do Thi Nguyen
 Grandfather, Tuat Van Nguyen born 07/15/1935. He did spend some time in Paris, I think when he was about in his 20s. Someone took him under his wing but he left back to Vietnam to search again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone - I've spent the last few days combing through all your posts on traveling Vietnam, lots of helpful stuff so thanks to everyone. Currently planning on flying to Hanoi mid Sept, spending a couple days there and bussing to Ha Giang, doing the loop on motorbike then coming back. 
 My bday is at the end of the trip and I'd like to splurge a little at a luxury-ish resort or something where I can really chill out and be taken care of. From what I've read so far, current top of the list is Da Nang, but just wanted to see if anyone has any other good recs. 
 Wants
 -Remote-ish, not overly touristy but still some kind of town action we can walk to for food, beers, etc.
 -Resort with a pool, preferably overlooking the beach
 -Proximity to other towns/beaches so we can rent scooters and go on little day trips
 Recommendations on Towns or actual resorts would be amazing!

Education is efficient and not stressful while work culture isn't as intense. Vietnamese students have more extracurricular activities to do such as football compared to Chinese students who study day and night from the start of life to prepare for the gaokao. Vietnamese suicide rates are much lower than Japan's or South Korea's.
 What cultural/social/political developments led to Vietnamese culture being more chill?

 I’m a 25 year old guy, coming from Canada. Will be in Saigon from Feb 13-23, then over to Hanoi.
 I’ll be around the District 1 area (in general, still confirming Airbnb) and I’d like to see if anyone wants to be friends? Or do some tourist things together?
 I love food and would like to try as much as I can around the area! I love experiencing new things, and getting tattoos. 
 I’m also open to any local ideas of things to do around the area, or day trips for motorcycle?
 Send me a DM, or comment!

I have not fully decided, but I'm leaning heavily on the smaller 150cc for less weight and fuel economy. I have past experience with 300cc-600cc motorbikes but it doesn't make sense to ride the bigger bikes in Vietnam. I'm looking to ride around town and occasional long rides.
 I'm open to getting the R3 or Ninja 400 as well.
 Please let me know what your best experiences are and what makes good sense. (Note: I will have an Airblade in case I'm lazy.)
 Thanks in advance!

 I wasn't raised In n Asian household so I was slowly learning about my Viet culture 
 I went to a Vietnamese restaurant, and I couldn't finish all my food, and I felt really bad about it.... because I didn't want to leave a bad impression. I heard that it's seen as wasting food, and is also disrespectful to the chef in other east Asian cultures just didn't know if it was the same for Viet. I feel really bad about it.

My dad got an MBA during the 1990s, and he went back home to work for an insurance company. My mom obtained a law degree in Vietnam and worked in a different field. My question is: what kind of jobs can my parents do? Obviously, I will be the person who helps them start over and climb the social ladder, but at the same time, I don't want them to struggle in old age. Can my dad start over and work at a company with his US degree, even though it will take several years to adjust and improve his English? What kind of jobs can my mom do? I have heard a lotta became nail techs, but I'm unsure if she could handle all the drama and long working hours. I honestly love them so much for all the work they put in to send me here, so at least I want to help them with a new life :( If any of yall in similar boats, I would love to hear yall your experiences!!

 Also since I'm already asking questions, what would be the best dog breed for apartment life? That doesn't need too much exercise...walking etc

If anyone can help me, I would really appreciate it. I have most of the journey mapped out but there's not much english language travel out there for Thanh Hoa so it's hard to find exactly where they are. 
 I remember going to 1) a tourist destination of a river with a lot of fish, and 2) a medium/large busy indoor/outdoor market on the way to Sam Son which had amazing pho and lots of street food. I don't remember and apparently didn't write down anywhere the names or specific locations of either of these places and google isn't helping me. I would love to know if these places still exist and if so exactly where they are :D Any help would be very appreciated, thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently in HCMC and am flying home on Thursday from Hà Nội. I’m assuming that due to new year, the flights direct are both expensive and almost non existent.
 Flight searching tools show most routes stop off at Phu Quoc. On my final day before going to Hà Nội, should I get an early flight to Phu Quoc, spend the day there (with my luggage which could be a pain) and then fly later into Hà Nội. Or am I better off getting flights closer together and spending less time on the island? 
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated

I'd kind of rather play things by ear when we get there, book our flights and hotels now and then when we get there do some things like river tour or an overnight cruise. But I'm not sure how crucial it is to book those things in advance. When we get there, can we talk to the hotel about booking a cruise or a guided tour or will it be difficult to locate those with short notice?

If so, do you pay customs and duties when you receive it back home? I’m wondering if I just deal with it and carry a few suits for the next 3.5 months, or if it makes sense to pay the shipping to Canada and then potentially pay the customs and duties on it. 
 I’m not sure how the process works, but it seems like this can be quite an expensive endeavour. Any advice would be appreciated!

 Just wanted to hear people's story so I can share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'm currently planning on a trip to Vietnam and thinking through transportation around the city- specifically grab availability to and from my hotels to the airport. Some of my hotels do offer airport transportation, but I can't figure out if their quoted prices are a serious upcharge compared to Grab.
 I've been to other countries before where ride share apps are available, but cars are limited (eg, it takes 30-40 minutes to get a car and the car cancels multiple times.) Is this a cause for concern with Grab in Vietnam?
 Hoping to ask for your insight about transportation and the reliability, availability, and pricing of Grab in:
  
Saigon Airport to District 3 around 11pm: Are cars available at this time? What is the ballpark of the cost for this?
 Hanoi airport to old town: I believe I've read on a Reddit thread that the car picking you up is not the one the app promised. Is this still the case? What would the pricing be?
 Halong Bay port to Van Don Airport: This is the one I'm worried about the most. Is Grab availability quick here? If not, does anyone have recommendations on how to get to the airport? Any companies you use that you recommend?
 Da Nang Airport to Hoi An: Are grabs available and reliable here? What is the ballpark of the cost for this?
  
As a female, my primary concern is safety, reliability, and flexibility. Our group is 3 people: will this change the type of car we need for Grab?
 Thank you so much for any insight you can give on any of these cities and your experiences in transportation here! I really really appreciate it.

 Does anyone have thoughts on what can I do to help and raise awareness? There's a stigma going on to not help them for fear of scams or something but wth... they are doing what they are doing because they need the money or it's their livelihood. 
 What's especially bothering me are the tourists! Like what are you doing bargaining with the locals? You have the privilege and luxury of travelling well and stuff, paying a little extra and giving them a better life. 
 Sorry, I was venting a little bit back to the topic, what can I do to help? I've been giving money here and there and it's endless. I'm buying stuff I don't need and I don't know what to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 So, I'm suffering from misophonia. Misophonia basically means you react extremely sensitive to some sounds. Not just - I don't like that sound - but full on rage / anxiety / panic / fear / aggression triggered immediately upon being subjected to it. It can be conditional though - meaning a sound only triggers that reaction in some context but not in others.
 Sounds like that for me are bass from music (no problem with bass from music I hear myself or when going to a night club but when trying to sleep f.x.). People smacking while eating. 
 Now - why do I direct this question specifically at Vietnamese people and not expats or tourists reading this? Well, Vietnam is a very loud culture and to make things worse sound proofing of buildings here doesn't seem to exist. At least I have never "seen" any. Windows especially are always leaking air and because of that sound from outside.
 So, I'd assume that a misophonically challenged person would be suffering a lot. But, is misophonia even a problem here? Maybe being subjected to very loud sounds all the time since birth provides immunity to it? Do you know of Vietnamese misophonics - are you one yourself? What are your triggers? How do you cope? How do you arrange yourself with it?
 Cheers
