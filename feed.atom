        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the current debate surrounding Affirmative Action, many people evoke "the poor Vietnamese who are uneducated and therefore need affirmative action". First off, most schools don't consider the difference between South East Asians and East Asians. Secondly, statistics paint a different picture. Look at this table from Pew Research:
 ​

 As you can see, Vietnamese born abroad, that is, the refugees, have low educational attainment. But for the generation that was born here, educational attainment is higher than whites. This, of course, contradicts the liberal narrative that Asians are doing better because of higher socio-economic status. Yes, they are correct -- many Vietnamese came to the US poor and without much education. But their children perform better than white Americans.
 The same story is told with income:

 So, pro-affirmative action advocates, stop using the Vietnamese as your token Asian minority to disguise your Asian racism. If you dig into the data, you might not like what you see.

Surely there are low-key strip clubs/girly-bars available under the radar, but why is Vietnam so conservative in this domain? Also, plenty of clubs in Mongolia (UB) and even majority-muslim Indonesia. 
 After living here for almost 4 years it's a little disappointing to not have ready access to a girly-bar, but I of course don't know why. What do you think Reddit?

I came across something online that said Vietnam has 52 tribes, and that most are in north Vietnam. That seems like A LOT for such a small place. I can google and find stuff on my own but I'm asking just in case someone might know some great material that I can read. It can be in Vietnamese. I can use Google Translate to translate the text. Thank you!
 I love this food YT channel based in Vietnam for going to visit the tribes around the world. This one is in Vietnam but I didn't catch which tribe it is. https://youtu.be/81aLMRK1ris
 These are all the tribes around the world that they visited. Reminded me of Anthony Bourdain who visited unknown places. https://www.youtube.com/c/BestEverFoodReviewShow/search?query=tribe

I’m visiting for the first time in nearly five years next year and I want to work on my Vietnamese. I learned a small amount from my mom growing up (she worked long hours and did not have much free time) but I otherwise grew up isolated from other Vietnamese people. I’ve tried a few app/services and I’m currently using Duolingo. I am aware, however, of how specific the Hue dialect is, and I’m worried that I’m learning bad habits and potentially making myself even more unintelligible to my relatives. Does anyone know of any services that specifically teach the Hue dialect? Or any tips for someone using Duolingo (which I believe is the northern dialect) and trying to apply what they’d learn to the Hue dialect? 
 Thanks!

However, Vietjet decided to change my flight for 10AM of the same day. First of all, I had never seen any airline bring forward a flight before. Secondly, they refused to refund me the entire amount, and the only solution offered was a "creditshell", which is a credit I can use for future flights with them. Now that I'm back from vacations and can afford to lose some time with this, I wanted to ask if anyone had any success obtaining a full refund from them for a similar situation, or if this is a lost cause and I should just forget about the 70$ I paid. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I flew here last month and sent my personal stuffs (shirts and comforter mostly) thru EMS. I received am email that I need to pay for tax and fee (approx. 1.9m vnd) because they were "gifts" from outside Vietnam. I keep on responding to their email clarifying that it's only shirts and a comforter and not gifts. 
 Has this happened to anyone before? How was it? What did you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm planning a trip to Hoi An soon and I'd love to know the answers to these questions:
  
Do the markets accept cashless/card payments?
 What do they sell at the markets besides souvenirs like bags and things?
 Are there any tourist apps/technologies that help you get around and give you information on the city?
 How's the wifi access when touring around?
 Is the area mostly full of tourists, especially in the markets? Or do locals also frequent those?
  
(Reposting this because I accidentally confused Hoi An with Hanoi)
 Thanks in advance!!

We have planned some of the trip, but we’re not sure if we want to go to Nha Trang or Phan Thiet/Mui Ne. We want to stay 3-4 days in one of those areas.
 Any thoughts?? Pros/Cons as to where to go? The trip is in the beginning of december, and temperature will be considered aswell.

As leaders of both China and Vietnam met recently and in the west the general opinion on the ccp government is pretty bad, now I know that Vietnam has worked to have good relations with both the us and china but It got me thinking what the average Vietnamese here think about China and the ccp?
 Idk if these kinds of posts are allowed but I guess you can remove it if it breaks any rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a Vietnam born and raised millennial. Now I’ve read a lot of writings where it is pointed out that MSG/bột ngọt aversion is originated from a 1968 racist research in USA. For me that explains why the western world is on the err side when it comes to MSG. 
 Still I don’t really know why a lot of Vietnamese, my parents, people of their age, my age, and younger (Gen Z) is still very skeptical with MSG. They:
  
 Makes an effort to avoid eateries/restaurants that they perceive to be using too much MSG
  Claims that they’re nauseous or having headaches when consuming too much or any MSG at all
  Avoid using MSG in their cooking
  
I do find 2-3 to be quite funny because Vietnamese are still using a lot of stock powder/bột nêm which is basically flavored MSG. 
 Is there any knowledge for where this MSG aversion in Vietnam originates? Is it because of the 1968 study that carries to Vietnam during the war and persists thereafter? Do you experience 1 and 2 yourself? I do want to listen to you guys.
 Do you think MSG induced sickness is placebo effect?

 If it matters, I’m a native speaker but moved to America at 7 years old. I can speak pretty well but my reading and writing skills are weaker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if the question is not clear, not sure how to formulate that ahah.
 So, I'm half vietnamese but I don't live in Vietnam. Their is a conflict in my vietnamese family about an apartment in Vietnam.
 My grandmother own an apartment and let my aunt/her daughter live in this apartment, free of charge. It was supposed to be only for a few years, but well... After a long time (more than 30 years), my grandmother wanted her daughter to leave the apartment, but her daughter claim that the apartment is now her's because my grandmother didn't reclaim her ownership for a long time.
 My grandmother has the legal document but she has never consulted any official since she got the apartment (so a long time ago).
 I just want to know what is true and how land ownership work in Vietnam. I think my aunt is just lying so that she can keep living in the apartment, but as I don't speak vietnamese it's hard to find informations.
 Not sure if I should post it here ahah, so sorry if not and for any of my mistakes !

It's super lovely and the people are really nice, some of the cutest super lovely people I've met. But I can't walk down the street without people on their scooters stopping asking me for a ride, people selling glasses, chips, paintings, bracelets, necklaces, tours and private car tours. I get people have to make a living. Which is totally understandable. It's probably more a culture shock to me than anything. I can't walk down the beach without being asked by people every 40 meters I walk if I want to buy their things and knickknacks. It's gotten to a point where I'm starting to feel rude to these people.
 But they also can't take no for an answer and are really really pushy and persistent. What are some ways to get your message across that I don't want to buy without being super rude or guilt tripped into buying? Thanks everyone.

 In the video they mentioned it only costs 70$ (which for the items offered there sounds like a very good price) but when I checked online I couldn't find any detailes about the price.
 Can anyone share their experience eating there and perhaps confirm if the price is about right?

 From what I hear, their dialect doesn't sound like Southern at all, more like Hue dialect but I am not sure. For those that have been to the Central Highlands region, do you know what dialect they speak? Would learning Southern Vietnamese be enough to converse with them or should I learn their specific dialect?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! 
 I am a videographer and world traveller from Canada currently visiting Cat Ba. While traveling through Vietnam I am making a video about my trip and I am personally very interested in the fishing traditions of the Vietnamese. When traveling I really value meeting with locals and properly experiencing the places I visit rather than going through the regular tourist route.
 I’m posting to see if there is anyone in the Cat Ba/ Local bay areas that would be willing to show me and my film partner the local experience for a few days. I would love to learn about traditions, see how people in the area have lived, meet families, and fish! It would be amazing to have someone who can translate as I love to interact with local people but am limited by only speaking English.
 The person would need to be okay with being on camera and would definitely get some beautiful photos of them on the adventure!
 Edit: when I say local guide, I do not necessarily mean a tour guide. I am looking more for a local who is interested in making some new friends and wants to show off and educate about the Vietnamese culture

But this time the visa attached to the passport didn't have the red stamp on it, but it had the signature and all the other information. So my question is, is this gonna be fine? Will this be stamped when I arrive? This is my first time doing this method so I'm being really worried about it and I can't find any information about it online. If this is dumb question I apologize but I really don't know how this method works so yeah, I kinda need some help here to be at ease.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just want to ask because I am not sure if it's just me. Basically in Vietnam I have been using Duolingo without having to pay but still receive benefits like unlimited hearts, no ad and free "purple" test.
 While I was in Canada, there's heart limit and it costs 100 gems to do the test but as soon as I returned to Vietnam, it switches back to Vietnamese policy. I did change my Google Play account to Canadian to install a few apps there (I cannot change it back within this year).
 Yesterday I realized all the limitation is applied on my app as if it's Canadian and they offer me to try the Super thing with CAD currency. I am wondering if it's just somehow use Google Play account as location now or is it the new policy in Vietnam? If no one else is affected by it, it's worth an email to their support I guess.

Mình có thể xin những lời khuyên của các đàn anh đi trước và các bạn kiểu nên lựa chọn mặt hàng kinh doanh nào không ạ, vì mình biết chắc mình chỉ có một thân một mình không ai hỗ trợ nên cơ hội của mình cần phải cẩn thận không là gục luôn 🥲 mình có định hướng là sẽ mở 1 shop bán phụ kiện 420 ở tại gia vì mình cảm thấy có thể phát triển được vì tại địa phương nơi mình sinh sống chưa có mặt hàng này nhưng cũng đang đắng đo lắm, nên mình cần tham khảo thêm ý kiến của các anh các bạn để có thêm định hướng và những kế hoạch duy trì cho kinh tế cá nhân để nuôi gia đình mình ạ 🥰 cảm ơn các bác đã đọc

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know much about Vietnam when it comes to Vietnamese culture, social rules, family etc, we want to get engaged soon and she always talks about having 3 children and such what is crazy for me as a Brazilian considering people here have a single child or nothing, I like her but I'm pretty much scared out with this thing, because I know Vietnam is a traditional country and people are too serious when it comes to posterity, at some extent I don't want her to be attached to someone who is not very up to have many children as I.
 Btw, I love Asia, the martial arts, I like how Vietnam is a country of resistance and fight against the imperialism, I'm totally fine with Vietnam, but still scared, I know more about China, which is a country I've been there before and I know the culture, however I can't read Chinese, same with the Vietnamese language it scares me out, I'm also scared of her family, you know I own tattoos which is not a big deal in the west but I know Asians are afraid of it, Btw I'm totally lost about this situation. 
 I'm a substitute PE teacher and she works at a pizzeria but she is studying gastronomy, also I have no clue about where to grow our children, Brazil, Vietnam or Europe, because I wish we could stay in Brazil as I love beaches, surf and such, but if we are going to have children we should go to the best place to grow them, also idk exactly what he parents think about this idea. I'm 24 she is 22, we have a long term relationship.
 Thanks.

 We had thought of doing the Ha Giang loop, but we do not have motorcycle experience and worried it would be quite dangerous. We would like to visit Cao Bang, but again not sure of the best way to travel there.
 Any recommendations for how we can experience this part of the world would be really appreciated!

 I'm visiting Vietnam for a couple of weeks and want to do something that's not touristy & extreme, fun, & unique to southeast Asia, like the long-tail riverboat racing in this video.
 Is there any boat racing like this around Ho Chi Minh city?
 Or are there any other special suggestions? 
 Thanks!

 I got a new one and wanted to retire the old one but iirc it's "illegal" to just burn it or throw it in the trash. Is it true? And how do you respectfully dispose it?
 I know about the American and Canadian flags but I think Vietnamese flag has a different process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Vietnam recently, there have been a number of establishments and places that call themselves "spa shoes". They are a place that provides shoe cleaning services, shoe repair, etc. As far as I know, the cost is quite expensive and Vietnamese people are willing to spend a few hundred thousand dong or even a few million just to make something for shoes. I don't know to you guys from other countries, do you guys do this? In my opinion, they are really too expensive and wasteful, why spend hundreds of thousands of dong just to wash a pair of shoes when you can do it yourself at home. Do people give too much importance to footwear when it is just an object to protect the feet. It's an honor for me to be able to hear your thoughts on this matter.

 I'm coming back in November and I'm looking for a rental scooter place which includes insurance for a period of 1month in TP HCM.
 Would you have any recommendations? 
 Also, any budget estimation I should count with?
 A friend I have on place found one for 120k/day and I wanted to have multiple opinions before saying yes.

Since I've never been to either of these cities, I'd like to know what people recommend. Please list your top 3s please, I would love to hear them.
 --------------------
 ​
 A fun little thing I do every city I visit is make list of the top 3 things I ate. When I think of a top 3 place, it's the items/restaurants that I enjoyed eating the most. 
 In case people were curious, here's a couple of top 3 food lists I made in other cities around the world.
 Taipei: 1) Lin Dong Fang beef noodle soup 2) New Mala Hotpot 3) Tian Jin Flaky scallion pancake
 Tokyo: 1) Ichiran Ramen! 2) Kobe Beef Teppanyaki HAKUSHU 3) Pablo Mini Cheesetarts

 Not sure which boots should I get as most hiking boots in MEC (Canada) offers goretex. Should I just get insoles?

 Myself, my wife and a group of 3 others are wanting to do the Ha Giang loop.
 We’ve been using moped for the last 4 months throughout SE Asia and I have experience with semi-automatics.
 We did the hai van pass a couple of days ago nil issues.
 We’re unsure whether our experience is enough for the loop, as we’ve spoken to people who have done it but they were with easy riders and haven’t ridden a motorcycle before.
 I’d be doubling my wife, that’s been our standard way to drive the last 4 months.
 Is this a risky endeavour and are we better off going with easy riders?

 Firstly I love Vietnam! I have been here so many times and every time I have loved it here! 
 Also, I must confess I have a soft spot for the West Lake and Hanoi in general. That's why I'm looking to settle here.
 Obviously I would need a job in Hanoi if I plan to stay here. My primary focus is to work as a Graphic Designer but honestly I'm open to work in any other area as long as it's legal and gets me a work permit to stay in Hanoi longer. 
 Can anyone guide me with regards to this? Thank you. 
 A bit about me:
 I'm currently in Sa Pa for a holiday and will be back in Hanoi tomorrow. I'm an Indian citizen. I have my bachelor's degree in information technology and have some work experience in software testing. Currently working as a freelance graphic designer (remotely for a Canadian ad agency)

I’m currently on my 3rd one month visa to Vietnam and I love this country so so much that I’m wanting to make it my home base as I travel the world. Between the people, the scenery, the food, culture and vibrancy it is just completely in a league of its own. 
 So fucking gorgeous. My question is - I’ve had 3 one month visas issues already (only one in my current passport? If that makes a difference) in the past 4 years. Next year I would be hoping to get a 3 month visa and obviously more again as I come back. Is there a limit to how many times I can leave and return before immigration start asking questions? 
 My current visa expires on the 6th November, I would like to go to South Korea for Halloween and come back but then I’d be on my 4th visa since 2018. Is it wiser to finish my time here and limit the amount of re-entries to this gorgeous country? Or am I overthinking!!?? 
 Thank you! Cảm ơn!

 A friend and I are traveling to Vietnam for a month in December. We are renting motorbikes from Tigit and plan on first traveling north and doing the Ha Giang loop, then traveling south along the country towards HCMC. The Honda Winner is 200 dollars less from Tigit and I have read that they are more common and easier to have repaired. I have also read that the XR is comfortable and it seems like it would be better adapted for rough terrain. We are both well experienced with riding motorcycles; however, it is our first time in Vietnam and I understand how different it is. Taking the price difference into account, does anyone have any advice on which bike we should rent? 
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am visiting Vietnam for tourism for two weeks and I am very excited about it! I am not sure on what is the best way to manage money while I will be there. I live in UK so I mostly use British pounds and I pay with card in most places. 
 From what I read, I should have cash because in many places only cash is accepted. What is the best way to manage money as a tourist? I was thinking about the following:
 1)bring cash (USD, would GBP be accepted at a decent rate ?) and then exchange it for the Dong once I am there
 2)bring only a minimum amount in USD just to have money if needed and then withdraw money in local currency from an ATM. Are there ATMs often? Do they charge huge fees? 
 I will backpack most of the trip so I would prefer to withdraw only a small amount of money at the time, I don't feel comfortable to have the money of two weeks of travel on me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you order a grab to the airport they may purposely take you to the wrong place. Then a taxi driver will explain that you are at wrong place and ask for a high price to go to correct place.
 My story: I told my initial grab driver i was at wrong place and after a few times of telling him it was wrong. He drove me to correct place reluctantly. I even tipped him.. I asked a security at correct place if it was in fact correct as i was second guessing myself. He was apparently working with them and told me to go ask someone at back. There were just more more grab drivers there. I was confused but i also didn’t want to be late. At this point I wasn’t aware of the scam and thought it was just a misunderstanding.
 New grab driver asked to pay to go to the initial wrong place saying it was the correct after i told him where i was going. Asks for stupid price once we arrived too. Thats when i detected a scam. But it was too late. Arrive there and thats when the taxi driver attempted to ‘help me’ (scam me) and drop off at correct place. And he will ask for money in us dollars. 
 Overall the scam wasn’t much in my currency. But i was so angry at the situation that i left the taxi without paying and told him to F off. This proved to work as he barely even chased. Probably because the security working inside the airport werent involved in the scam like the outside security was.
 My advice: act angry and dont back down. It worked for me as i was legitimately pretty angry at how they were fucking with me and risking missing my flight and losing a lot of actual $

I'm looking to understand more about the Vietnamese attitude towards sex (of any orientation) during this period. If you were living in the country at the time and would be happy to talk with me about your experiences, please let me know! Many thanks!

 If this is correct, will everything be back to normal already at February 1st? Or should I wait a little longer?

 What happens if I end up with Covid but without any symptoms beyond a common cold? Of course, I would stay in my hotel but would I be forced to go to some government location?
 Have many places closed permanently because of the harsh economic conditions? Any chance that borders will close again if there's a new wave of infections or is the vaccine trusted enough?

Sorry as I know this is a bit TMI, but I am wondering what to do/if any expats or locals in Vietnam have experience getting medication for this? I have used boric acid suppositories at home and they work great, so I'm specifically wondering if anyone has any knowledge if these are sold in Vietnam. 
 I'm currently in HCM, so I should have a lot of options I'm guessing, but so far have not had any luck.
 Any advice is appreciated!!!

 I am an international Expat, who works online.
 My question now is, which area do you guys recommend? I don't need a crazy party scene arround me with many drunken tourist party people but I would appreciate to have access to gyms, nice local restaurants/street food, nice areas to go for a walk(best would be in some kind of an old town environment for the walk), modern apartment to live in(price does not really matter but don't need a super fancy place).
 My girlfriends sister lives on the eastern part of district 2 - very close to district 9. So we thought about staying close to her place(lake view city) 
 Is this considered as a nice area and are there things to do? I think it's a little far from the actual city center but maybe there are enough things to do.
 Thanks in advance for your opinions
 Cheers ✌🏻

 I(26M) have a CELTA certificate, a degree in Hospitality and Food Technology(hated hospitality for the lack of salary and the fact its basically manual labour) and now I am about to finish my Master in Computer Science(love problem solving and banging my head against shitty code that wont debug itself). And I plan on coming to HCMC as a teacher in Nov,2022.
 I have been following the jobs (Tech and Teaching) a lot since the past 2 years and it seems like the usual pay ranges from 400k/hr for English Centres to 700k/hr for Universities. Usually teachers manage about 80-100 hours a month which roughly averages to 40-50 million per month for inexeperienced ones(with the right credentials) or with certain correct skin tones (without…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here goes nothing so no need to be judgmental/cynical/sarcastic because might delete later. Pretty much as the title says. Writing this after few failed attempts at dating.
 33M, US, educated, good career, healthy, decent looking, average body (6'1), pretty much everything normal. If anything, I don't go out much and have high standards. I tried dating locally but nothing worked and seems like the dating scene is getting smaller as I get older. I had a long term relationship with Vietnamese girl in the past that didn't work out, but I still think of her today as the one that got away(just fond memories). Also, have many close VN friends and I love the culture, hence this post. I tried dating apps, change location and talked to few girls from HCMC. I even traveled there to meet but felt like they weren't sincere and not genuine.
 I read somewhere here that it's more trustworthy if friends/colleagues make introductions but all of my friends are older and dont know any single ladies. So, anyone want to be my matchmaker? (obviously after knowing me)

 I land in Vietnam at 07:35 on Friday the 16th of December and depart at 20:55.
 I'm looking for an 10ish hour tour - Pick up at 08:30 returning to the airport for 19:00. There is me and my mother. I'd like to find someone who can take us on a tour of the city; see the key sites, someone who is willing to accompany us and our bags (secure parking will be a necessity) for the day.
 Pick up and drop off at the airport is a must. We're not married to anything in particular in terms of what we see, we'd like a local expert to tell us what we shouldn't miss as people with 10 hours to explore the city!
 Happy to pay (comparatively well compared to tour companies) for the right person who can put together an itinerary for us.
 Can anyone recommend someone? or volunteer themselves?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello reddit,
 Me and my friends want to visit Vietnam in a couple of months. We were thinking of buying motorbikes in the north, and riding from Hanoi to Saigon. 
 The only thing is, my two friends don't have a driving license (no car, scooter, or motor) and have none or barely any driving experience, not even in the European country I'm from.
 I do have a driving license for a car and a scooter for some years (not for a motorbike) and would consider myself an experienced/good driver, but even I am quite hesitant about riding a motorbike in Vietnam. The odds for two (if i count myself in three) totally inexperienced motorcycle drivers to get into any kind of accident when riding in Vietnam for a month seem higher than acceptable to me.
 On top of that I'm worried about my friends, I don't want to see them in a serious accident in Vietnam, far away from home and without any insurance. 
 They just shrugg it off and say it'll be alright and tell me I shouldn't worry about it. They don't seem to understand the risks. 
 Are my concerns justified? I know it's almost impossible to go to Vietnam and not ride a motorbike, but I want them to at least understand the dangers and risks.

 The closest I've found is Berlin by Khoi Vu, Fever and Gap May by Wren Evans, and Het Thoi by Ngot. Even then, most of these are pop or other genres.

 When I search up Vietnamese funk, I can only find songs that don't sound funky. 
 Here are some examples of city-pop or funk songs I'm looking for:

 Visiting Vietnam in the next few months and after some recommendations or personal experiences from people on here.
 Mostly like being away from overly touristy places, prefer chill places, meeting local people and getting stuck into the local food culture. Language barrier isn't a problem. 
 Is the far Northwest a good place to head off on a motorbike trip, Lao Cai and that whole area Son La etc etc apart from Sapa? Possibly instead of Ha Giang and the more frequented areas. 
 Anyone got any experience in Hai Phong, Dong Hoi, Hue? Or just any other recommendations in general from the far north to the center (visa too short for entire country) 
 Thanks alot appreciate any responses :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was born in Vietnam but have lived overseas for most of my life. Been trying to get back to my roots and understand the culture better by consuming more Vietnamese modern media.
 There's a game show I watch called 2 Ngày 1 Đêm. Originally I enjoyed the show enough, but over the last few episodes, the show's use of live animals just doesn't sit quite right with me.
 First it was a game to capture duck. Then another game where they toss a whole bunch of mini crabs around to find special ones with numbers stuck to them. But the worst one was in the final episode where they were pulling this poor baby pig around, not with a proper pet harness, but just a piece of rope, then the poor thing got picked up and run around whilst screaming in distress. The sounds of his scream honestly stresses me out.
 Having grown up in Vietnam, I know we still have a long way to go in terms of animal rights, but I did not expect to see animal abuse on national television. Honestly I wonder what other people would think when seeing this on Vietnamese TV. This particular show originates from Korea. The Korean show has hundreds of episodes and animal abuse was never in any of them. How is it that the Vietnamese show cannot produce even 20 episodes without involving distressed live animals, do the producers lack creativity that badly? 😔

 Anyone remembers her? Really miss her songs and emotional voice when she hits the high note.
 According to this website: Dalena, she has not been appearing any big show since 2007 in Asia 55.
 Does anyone know what she is doing? She is still singing?

 I am going to be in Vietnam for a month, starting November 2. I am going to be based in HCMC, but I will be free to move around the country. I have received my fourth dose of COIVD vaccine, and am happy to mask up and to practise social distancing in my home country of Canada, but I am curious to know what people in Vietnam are currently doing regarding COVID protocols. In my part of Canada, it seems many people are now throwing caution to the winds re: COVID. Is the same happening in Vietnam?

 Anyone can download template and add their own text, so I was just wondering if anyone tried to create VN version of this game, thanks.

 This time we'll be landing on Christmas day in Hanoi (late at night of course), and we will in Saigon for International New Years eve and day. What should we expect?, are there celebrations?, are day trips still happening? (cu chi tunnels tour type things).
 TIA and looking forward to coming back!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! My friend and I are visiting Hanoi and HCM some time early to mid December. We understand HCM’s a more comfortable coolish warm weather. For Hanoi, we’ve been reading up and watching videos but we are still quite confused about the weather and is unsure of what to prepare in terms of wear because we’ve read and seen people wearing anything from shorts to padded jackets… 😂
 We understand that the weather can be quite volatile and thus layering is key, but we’d just like to get some sense of what the weather is like in both cities, and whether Hanoi especially requires anything even remotely close to a padded jacket? 
 For context, we come from a tropical climate within SEA! 
 Many thanks! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While riding all over Vietnam from South to North I would always come across a wedding party, in rural areas, there would be a big tent on the side of the road that would extend out onto one lane of the road. The first time I saw this caught me by surprise as I rode past and suddenly got hit with sonic waves and my ear drums felt like they were about to explode. I almost go blown off my bike. I came across 3 weddings that day so I knew what I was in for. But I have always wondered, why do the have speakers at a wedding reception the Size of a house that are turned up to 100% with 100 guests inside drinking like there is no tomorrow. I'm sure they are all yelling. Mot Hai Ba Yooooooo.... Is there a reason behind having the big ass sound system that triggers the earthquake richter scale monitors all over Vn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in Vietnam for the first time, with my partner.
 We are in Hoi An currently.
 I'll be honest, I'm not really enjoying it today.
 It's way too muggy and hot, the river and city is dirty as hell.
 And there's so many scammers and people trying to hustle you.
 There doesn't seem to be much to do, and everywhere we have eaten (trying all the top rated places) has been dissapointing.
 What is there to do here really? Drink warm beer, inhale pollution and look at a dirty river? Am I missing something? 
 Anyone have any suggestions please.
 Edit. People asking why I didn't plan this properly, this was a last minute change of plans as Japan still didn't ease restrictions when we made the switch (they eased restrictions literally 2 days after we changed flights and bookings)

 Is it ok to keep the ashes in your home? Would buddhist temples bless the remains?
 I asked my mom and sisters but they said they usually dont talk about things like this at the temple or not really sure.

 Does anyone know how I could track one down to buy and have sent to the US? I'd love to surprise him with it
 (If anyone is visiting and can get their hands on one to bring back to the US and ship to me let me know!)

My mom and dad are the one that hit first, got more coughing and loosing voice (only my dad) and that’s somehow hits me and the entire family with symptoms like fever, headache, muscle pain, eye pain, coughing and puke. Not only my family, even the teachers that I have known in Bien Hoa City were got Covid or got sick. I just don’t know what diseases that caused my whole family to be sick but things were started to get dire when the cases were spreading wild in HCM city. I just don’t know if I got some health to study and doing exam tomorrow but I’m thinking that it’s getting worst.

 After all, coming up with a modern alphabet for a language is no walk in the park.
 Although, Vietnam doesn't usually make foreigners citizen of Vietnam, there has been instances where Foreigners have been granted Citizenship:
 https://vietnamnet.vn/en/the-first-foreigner-granted-vietnamese-citizenship-E66920.html
 Or title of 'honorary citizen of vietnam':
 https://vovworld.vn/en-US/news/alexandre-yersin-awarded-posthumous-title-of-honorary-citizen-of-vietnam-272608.vov
 Or 'The honorary Citizen of the Capital City':
 https://vovworld.vn/en-US/news/former-vietnamrussia-friendship-organization-president-hanoi-is-always-in-my-heart-277455.vov
 Seems odd that Francisco de Pina hasn't been awarded any of these.

 I'll be visiting Vietnam in November. We are planning on travelling from HCMC to Phnom Penh and visiting the Mekong Delta. However I can't find any info about 3 or 4 day tours starting in HCMC and ending in Cambodia, that are not luxury cruises which cost 1000+ $ per person. Do you know any websites where I can book those tours? Or do you have any other tips to plan my trip in Mekong Delta?
 Thanks very much! :)

 First of all, I am fully aware of the fact that some East Asian countries like South Korea, Japan have unwritten strict dress codes and it is generally not acceptable for women to wear very short jeans shorts that reveal your legs too much. Its also not accepted if your buttcheeks are visible. As far as I know, women dress very modestly in South Korea and Japan(even during hot summers) to practice modesty. Would u say Vietnam is similar to South Korea and Japan in that regards? Will I stand out a lot amongst the crowd if I wear jeans shorts that are sho…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company is thinking about sending me to Vietnam a few times a year for a project, and rather than bringing my US Verizon number, it was recommended that I get a prepaid Vietnam SIM (such as Viettel, Vietnamobile, etc), keep topping up regularly to keep the number active (so I don't have to buy a new one everytime). I've done this successfully when I was stationed in Singapore. 
 Question is, is it possible to have a Viettel (or other VN carriers) SIM registered and shipped overseas (so that I have it prior to my trip), as well as international roaming activated (just so I can receive SMS while overseas)? 
 Thx!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello--- I'm a Việt Kiều and I've been researching folk religion partially for a story I want to write. I came across an article (offroadvietnam.com/vietnam-info/customs-and-rites/funerals) about burials that mentioned this: 
 "Sometimes, coffins are temporarily buried in the gardens to discourage thieves from robbing the valuables inside. In the case of young virgin girls, the burial place is often nearby the home so that it can be watched. Some rural people believe that the head of a virgin girl is very valuable and may be conserved and turned into the most powerful and omnipotent talisman through special ceremonies. Persons who have the talisman are believed to be omnipotent and invulnerable." 
 I found that really intriguing but couldn't find anything else referencing that belief online. Has anyone heard of this, or anything related? And are there any keywords that might help me research further? I'm also curious what they mean by 'rural people' here...
 Cảm ơn!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! Finally decided to take a vacation for a few days and booked a 6 day trip to Hanoi. I have been to Ho Chi Minh and I really enjoyed it, and friends of mine have told me Hanoi is even better! So I am thrilled to visit but also don't know what I should be seeing, eating, experiencing...
 I love culture, good food, good coffee, walking around and sightseeing, an occasional good cocktail, and enjoy the special, unique things that every city has to offer. I will be staying in Old Town, if that helps, but I don't mind booking a taxi or any other type of transportation. A friend even recommended I visit Laos from there, for a day or two, which I'm open to doing.
 Any recommendations are very much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in and out of vn for many years since graduating university and working for a couple of large international companies. So I've lived in a bubble of corporate housing, spending accounts, and HR departments that took care of everything.
 That said, I've now another, let's say it's more of a necessity than an opportunity, to relocate back again indefinitely, but out of the corporate world, 100% on my own.
 Visa and housing are all taken care of, so no issues there. But I'm more interested in the small things that people had found useful when keeping a significant presence and residence in the US but coming to vn indefinitely.
 Mainly how to effectively bank? Id like to leave all assets in the us with US banks and brokerages and just move funds to vn as needed. I generate my income in USD outside of vn and anticipate keeping it like that. But no doubt will need to bring in large amount of cash to settle down. 
 Which banks work better than others for those with foreign US assets? What credit cards are most efficient/effective?
 Most other aspects are square, but as I said I was living in a financial bubble I didn't need to worry about.
 Advice?

 I have some mesterolone which is a weak steroid used to help alleviate the symptoms of low testosterone. It's just a tablet so not injectables or anything. However, I don't have a prescription. Will the Vietnamese customs be bothered about me taking in a couple weeks supply? What will happen if they find them? I've heard about extremely strict punishments for taking certain drugs in but it seems that is only for drugs of abuse. I don't want to risk ending up in prison!
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am a second-generation viet kieu born in Belgium
 My parents fled Vietnam and settled in Belgium where I was born.
 They both lost their vietnamese citizenship from what I know and are now belgian citizens.
 For my part, I was born and lived in Belgium until recently.
 I speak vietnamese good enough to live in Vietnam on my own and have a vietnamese name.
 ​
 I recently decided to move to Vietnam to live here.
 I am under a 5-year visa exemption and still work remotely for a Belgian company (no work visa then).
 I am considering my options to obtain vietnamese citizenship to settle here for good in the future.
 The dual citizenship is possible from what I know.
 ​
 From what I could find, the easiest way would be to ask one of my parent to regain its vietnamese citizenship first so I can apply as the child of a vietnamese citizen.
 Is there any other solution?
 It is not that they are not willing to do it but since it is my personal decision, I do not want to force them to take the decision to regain citizenship for me.
 Thanks for reading me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I’m visiting Vietnam looking for a place to bring a gift back from Vietnam for a female family friend. The two cities I’ll be visiting next are Saigon & Nha Trang. This friend is very well off and doesn’t really like tacky items or fakes (knockoffs for name brands). Her style is more classy (eg. pearl jewelry). She doesn’t care about brand names either, so it doesn’t matter about the price.
 I’m trying to find something locally made that’s of decent quality and not tacky - a shawl / scarf, jewelry, etc. that can fit in a suitcase. Any suggestions of stores and / or items? I was initially thinking an ao dai, but I heard these are better when tailored to a person. 
 Thank you for the help :)

 I'm new to VN, just bought scooter on FB but I'm worried it's stolen? Didn't even occur to me -- I feel so horrible & guilty. I took blue crd from seller...yes ik I should've checked it first, but I'm naive I guess -- so it's got the VNese owner's info on it. Wht should I do? If I report it, will the bike return to originl owner? If I keep it, will I get in big trouble? I did shell out good money, just weighing out every option. Thx for reply

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a Vans style vietnamese sneakers brand. "Designed in Saigon, made in Vietnam". It's dirt cheap, with basic sneakers costing 20USD only !
 ​
 And... They do have big sizes for westerners. I wear 45,5 EU and 45EU was fine, they have up to 46EU with every sizes available in the store I went !
 ​
 Quality wise it's better than Vans, the sole is much better.
 I found this by surprise down the street is HCMC, they have several stores there. I highly recommend you checking out. Will definitely buy more pairs to bring back in Europe also.
 ​
 ​
 I don't have any affiliation with them but I found that it's so cool to buy local brands here, and didn't saw any post here or in other expat' communities talking about this brand, so thought it was worth sharing with you.

 If you know other nice vietnamese brands worth checking out it would be nice if you can share it in the comment section.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not a Karen post! I just wonder if anyone else noticed something similar. 
 I’ve traveled between HCM and Hanoi a lot this summer and have never had any problems with the food, however yesterday was awful at multiple places. I wonder if there is some airport-wide issue that’s happened recently or if yesterday was just a lot of bad luck. 
 Many VN airports have a Lucky Star Cafe and I usually get a sandwich from there. They have the sandwiches on display in a window and you pick one, they take it out and heat it, and hand it over. At Hanoi airport yesterday, I looked at one cafe and all the meat looked super dried out, as if it had been sitting at room temp for hours, or even more than a day. All the meat on all the sandwiches looked like that. I decided to try another location of Lucky Star — same thing: dry, discolored looking meat. I decided to order Burger King instead because it was right next to me and because at least that food is cooked when you order it. 
 The BK fried chicken sandwich was utter shite! It looked like it had been fried at too high of a temperature for not a long time. It looked like a burned brick on the outside and the inside was cold mush. I had to spit it out as soon as I took a bite and I just left. I didn’t even want to try anything else. I am aware I should not have high quality expectations for fast food but it should at least be edible. 
 I got a bottle of water from a third Lucky Star location and all the sandwiches there looked the same as the first two. I just decided not to try anything else at the airport. 
 I know this could be a huge coincidence, but maybe there is a wider issue? Is there some electricity issue fucking with the food equipment? Has there been so little traffic that they haven’t moved their products? This is the only time I’ve had bad food at the airport so it just seemed weird that four different places had food issues. What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I only noticed this while living abroad. I don't think I have ever known any Vietnamese that are scared of spiders. Sure there are people who are afraid of cockroaches, roaches or even bugs, but I tried to ask all my friends, even ladies, nobody is afraid of spiders.
 But when I was abroad, so many people are scared of them, to the point of yelling, including men (sorry I don't mean to judge, I myself hate other bugs too). Of course there are some who will take care of the problem, but when I was there, I was the go-to person to take care of relocating them (I hate killing them because I like that they eat bugs but my wife wants me to kill them all the time 😂)
 So... is it true that generally we Vietnamese are not afraid of spiders? Why?

There is nothing on Netflix too.

However, i noted that I am required to have a Vietnam phone number for verification before i can do any purchasing.
 Is there any way I can make a purchase without the Vietnam phone number? 
 Item I'm buying is an simple Ao Dai for guy as I will be having a Vietnam Theme party on the night that I arrive in Hanoi and thought of wearing the Ao Dai as costume. Not sure how common such shops are in Hanoi and the price range of male Ao Dai being sold around the area. Hence decided to shop via Shopee.
 Anyone can help?

Based on my past experiences, it seems like the only way to get the best deals is by having relatives order and ship it to you. I’m just wondering if there are any shops in Vietnam that work with overseas brides and how the shipping works. Again, with past experiences, I’m afraid that my packages will get intercepted.

From what I have read about FULRO is that they are considered to be a collation of other political ethnic minorities groups, most of them were Chams Hindus and Muslims, Montagnards Christians, and Buddhist Khmer Krom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My significant other is the daughter of Vietnamese parents that moved to Japan as refugees. The problem is: even though she was born and raised in Japan, Japan does not recognize her as a citizen. The only way for her to receive citizenship in Japan is to work for 3+ years as an office lady and pay the government X amount of taxes. 
 We aren't doing that, and recently I received a job in VN.
 Because she doesn't have a passport or citizenship anywhere in the world, her visa status will likely be a little difficult to navigate (she has a special visa that allows her to visit Vietnam for 6 month periods but requires her to return to Japan). 
 Has anyone here been in a similar situation? 
 She knows that she won't apply for Japanese citizenship (and has little desire to now). So, how difficult would it be for her to apply for Vietnamese citizenship? 
 She speaks Vietnamese fluently and has a Vietnamese name, if that makes a difference.
 Thanks!

 So far thinking 
 2 days in HCMC ??? 7 days in Hanoi to see Halong Bay and try and do 1 trip to somewhere cool in the north
 I guess there's a gap after HCMC but any help would be great thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I booked some internal flights in Vietnam via GoToGate, where they asked me to put "First and Middle Name" in one field, and Last Name in another field.
 I put in the names as instructed, but now when trying to check my booking via VietJet Air's website when it requested "Middle and Given Name," I was only able to actually check my booking after flipping it around as "First and Middle Name," and the VietJet Air website now lists the name as "LAST NAME FIRST NAME MIDDLE NAME."
 The issue is I've booked these tickets on the behalf of others, who are Vietnamese citizens, and the names on their passports of course list it as "Last Name Middle Name First Name", which is different from what's on their tickets. Granted, the GoToGate e-ticket also instructs everyone to print the document out where it also has their name printed as LAST NAME/FIRST NAME MIDDLE NAME to bring with them to the airport. Does anyone know/have experience with this if this will cause any issues when receiving their boarding pass at the airport and boarding the plane?

 How many CCs bike can i hire at most with just a car license
 How much roughly will it cost to rent a motorbike for 2 weeks?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halongbaytours.com aka Blue Dragon tours is a scammy tour agency. I booked a tour with the understanding that I can cancel before 30 days and get a full refund. Something came up and I requested cancellation. They have basically ghosted me and didn’t refund my deposit. Luckily I can dispute with my credit card company.
 Companies like these give all Vietnamese tour operators a bad name. I’m surprised that they don’t realize the Internet will amplify bad business practices. They will lose more future business than its worth a small deposit in the grand scheme of things.
 For anyone who book tours, please find a local tour operator on Facebook instead of using any online website Unless it’s a legit International site. Don’t pay any deposit, only pay when you get there.

There was one bad thing however today, as I couldn't find my driver license anywhere. Which baffles me because I always have it on me in the same card holder. But yeah it's gone and that is a real bummer because I was looking forward to renting a scooter or motor to drive around the area. I found a travel blog on the internet however saying that to rent a 50cc scooter you don't necesarilly need to show/have a license. The last time I rented one of those in Indonesia it was able to go up to 80 km/hour so that is fine for my needs. So I wanted to check here. Do you have an idea if it is possible to do this without a license? (Just to be clear btw, I do have a license and a lot of experience driving, I just don't have the license itself on me while traveling because I didnt have time to get a new card today. )

However, something weird happened to us while we were in Hanoi, twice two different men tried to grab at my husband's shoes. My husband kicked at their hands and they tried to grab his shoes multiple times while muttering something we couldn't understand. We managed to get away both times, but I was wondering what would have happened if they had managed to actually get a hold of his shoes? My husband thought they were trying to glue something to his shoe and then have him pay to get it off. Any idea what was going on?

 And for those who don't know - please dont try it. This sport requires lots of luck and special skills.
 Especially if you don't want to tear your shoes, tear your clothes =))) Dogs can bite your shoes even when you are at home, let alone when going out and poke the neighbor's dog, right? Haha.
 And if your shoes are bitten and torn, you can bring them to a shoe care store near you to have them sewn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an English 27 y/o female living in London. I have a 1st class Fine Art degree and currently studying a PGCE in secondary art and design (post graduate that qualifies me to teach full British GCSE art and design curriculum and A-level). I have teaching experience in art and geography. I recently started a beginners Vietnamese course with SOAS. 
 I was preparing to move to Vietnam to teach English and COVID hit, which pressed me to study my post grad and become an art teacher.
 I want to live the rest of my 20s and onwards in a beautiful exciting country, to immerse myself in a new culture, learn a new language, to grow and truly live. I want to really take some time to move to a country to study to make my best attempt at learning the language, meeting new people and also to rent a studio to have the time to develop my art practice. 
 Here in UK I'm seasonally depressed 6 months of the year, overworked to afford to get by and uninspired and to be honest I've always felt this way about life here. 
 The reason I chose to study to become an art teacher is in some desperate hope that I might be able to utilise these skills and find work in an international school abroad as a British curriculum art teacher or gain a residency visa back to Australia (closer to Vietnam at least). Don't get me wrong I do love working with young people.
 Working as an art teacher in London is something like £35k a year. But honestly I'd take a sickening pay cut to move and have more time to truly live. International schools in vn seem few and far between that need art teachers. I would obviously very much love to keep progressing with my art related career, as it's my specialism and love but I would consider teaching English if It means I have more time off and have enough money to work on my art and take Vietnamese lessons. 
 Thoughts anyone? What kinds of jobs/hours/pay What do you think my prospects will look like if I move to Vietnam. 🇻🇳🍵

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, what is the best officially recognized Vietnamese language course that is available in Hanoi?
 a bit of backstory: In 2020 I decided to change careers and return to university. I am doing it all online through a university that is outside of Vietnam. 2021 I got an online job that allowed me to get through covid times. My employment contract there ends at the end of January 2023.
 Having worked from home for the last two years, my Vietnamese skills have diminished a lot, and they weren't that good to begin with. 
 I have a year until my university degree is finished and I then plan to reenter the workforce, but until then, I have two options: return to my extremely expensive home country where I will need to finish my studies and work at the same time, due to cost of living OR continue my online studies here while also studying Vietnamese.
 My online studies are in a field that I am already quite knowledgeable in, so I am kind of bored to be honest. And on top of that, I have a lot of free time. So I would much prefer to stay here and study Vietnamese and live off of the savings for a year before returning to work.
 The last point to add, my fiancée (also a foreign national) and I are getting married, so I could return once that paperwork is finished but her countries government makes that of Vietnam look like a well oiled machine, so I don't want to rely on that. 
 TLDR: I have a year off and would prefer to stay in Vietnam to study than go home to my home country. What are the best options?

 I'm wondering if anyone has experience getting a licence to legally drive / ride a scooter in Vietnam?I'm headed over to Da Nang later this year, planning to stay for some months by doing border runs with tourist e-visas. Thinking that it'll be fun to ride over there and explore around the city and surrounding areas. Also get the impression VN has pretty intense traffic accident rates, so I'm keen to get insurance that covers this in case I get caught out - need to be driving legally to be covered though. I'm a New Zealander who is licensed to drive legally in my own country, but I guess I need to upgrade this somehow to ride over there. Do any foreigners have experience getting licensing to ride legally in Vietnam?
 Thanks!

 I'm currently in HCMC (from the US) and my Mac refuses to charge. When plugged in, it stays at its current percentage but won't go any higher. It also feels very staticky so I'm keeping it unplugged for the time being. Is there anything a can buy so I can charge my laptop? I'll be in Vietnam for the rest of the month. Also if anyone knows a specific place to buy what I need would be appreciated too. I'm in D1 if it helps. I've attached a picture of the outlet at my Airbnb. 
 Thanks!
 Update: I left my MacBook on plugged in while I was away and it continued to charge even though it says not charging. I believe the issue is the charger so I'll try to buy a new one tomorrow. Thanks everyone!!

 I ended up getting pretty ill last night, so much so i spent the night on drip due to dehydration. Turns out a triple whammy of e-colo, salmonella and cholera were the culprits!
 I cant quite pin down what might have cause it, as I say, ive been indulging. But any food/drink stuff you’d advise to stay away from to avoid this in the future? Im not drinking tap water, but aside from that havnt avoided anything yet. Cheers!

But it's never made clear that this a massive downgrade from before when far more countries could get their visa letter online.
 How do you feel about this? Do you care that you're shutting out over half the world's countries, for what is ostensibly, no reason?

I know a few years back Blackpink performed in Hanoi, but they're not coming back for their new world tour. I'm just using them as an example because I have not seen any big name artist come to Vietnam recently ... why is that? 
 I'm wondering if it's a covid thing, but other Southeast Asian countries (Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines) have a lot of big artists performing there so maybe it's not that. 
 Is it a popularity thing? Just curious because I love attending concerts and it's just sad I won't be able to hear live music from my favorite artists when I spend my time in Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got scratched by a dog in Hanoi, Vietnam. Seemed to be a puppy (or a miniature breed), since it was playful. It ran up to me and tried jumping on my legs, then ran away. Not aggressive. It was sitting by a store and looked healthy & clean, but had no collar on it.
 The scratch didn’t visually bleed and I don’t see broken skin, but it left a white line (like when you scratch your own arm with your nail). The dog also licked my leg (no visible open wounds, but I had shaved that morning so you never know).
 Do I need to get post exposure rabies shots, or am I being paranoid? Sorry in advance if this is incredibly stupid. I lived a part of my childhood in India, where rabies is a big deal.

 What should I know about finding a good place to stay and rest my head. How do I know what are the bad areas of town?
 I have a friend 35f VNese who wants me to visit w her. Is there anything I should know that could be a legal issue? Vì du: in Muslim countries a man and a woman if not married or family can’t have a hotel room together. 
 What is the to do in Há nội and what is there to do in Vinh. I like to eat VNese food because I have a few Viet kiểu friends who introduced me to like bun rieu and bun Bo hue. I’m creative sometimes and I love nature.
 Any and all feedback is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Srs help needed for Central Vietnam Trip.
 In Short, I am arriving in Vietnam (Central & North) for 18-21days. I am coming in to DN first.
 However, I just noticed that it is the rainy season & i didn't expect Hoi An/DN/Hue to be flooded that badly. As you can see my past post history, others have mentioned that the flood generally come and go quickly and 99% of the cities/ tourist spot are still accessible.
 After seeing the news on DN/Hue ytd and today, I am even more worried and really need some advice here from the viet community. (I have done my research online and reddits alrdy to prevent overposting, but i really need some assurance and guidance. Hope my post doesnt get removed).
 ​
 Q1) How true is it that the flood doesnt impact 99% of the cities and tourist spot are generally accessible?
 Q2) If it rains heavily, How long does the flood takes to recede so that I can travel off?
 Usually, Are the railway trains station still accessible during floods?
 Q3) Even tho, it is hard to predict the likelyhood of floods, & I can still visit the 7-14days weather forecast. But if the city (DN/Hoi An/ Hue) has already flooded before, and the typhoon/storm heads somewhere else, are they still prone to flooding?
 Q4) Aside from weather forecast, what can i search on to warn myself of upcoming flood?
 Q4) Are the northern Vietnam safe from flooding? So i can change my plans?
 ​
 This is my first 20+ days trip to vietnam, and i really didn't foresee this coming. Appreciate many help

 I am visiting Vietnam next month and was wondering if I should book Vietjet flights. They are quite inexpensive as compared to others. How has your experience with them been? The official Vietjet website looks somewhat funny to me and I want to be sure that it's a reliable airline. If there is some problem with the flight on their end (delay/loss of baggage/cancellation of flight/whatever else), will travel insurance take care of it?
 Would appreciate advice/suggestions/narration of your own experiences with the airline.
 Thanks a ton!

 I am planning a short trip to Tokyo (from Noi Bai) and I was wondering which airline was recommended. 
 I have heard/read very negative stories about Vietjet so I was thinking of going with a different carrier like Hahn, but I think that they are operated by Vietjet anyway? 
 I'm seeing options with Vietnam airlines also but they have layovers in SGN, I would prefer a direct flight. 
 Any opinions? Is Vietjet really that bad?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Đồ biểu sau thể hiện các giai đoạn ba loại chữ viết chính của tiếng Việt được sử dụng. Theo các dữ kiện lịch sử thì:
 • Chữ Hán được cho là bắt đầu được sử dụng ở Việt Nam khi Thái Thú Sĩ Nhiếp dạy thi thư cho người Việt vào khoảng năm 200.
 • Chữ Nôm có văn tự sớm nhất từ thời nhà Lý, xuất hiện đầu tiên trên các chuông chùa từ năm 1076.
 Cả chữ Hán và chữ Nôm đều không còn được sử dụng rộng rãi từ sau kỳ thi Hội cuối cùng ở Việt Nam năm 1919.
 • Chữ Latin được chính thức sử dụng trong các công văn ở Việt Nam theo nghị định do Phó Đề đốc Marie Gustave Hector Ohier ký từ năm 1869.
 Có thể thấy, chữ Latin là loại chữ viết còn khá trẻ của tiếng Việt.
 Các bạn nghĩ sao về các loại chữ viết của tiếng Việt?

I wonder if anyone who has sent such a large amount of stuff to Vietnam could give me some tips ? I did research on the Internet but there are so many companies and there aren't a lot of reviews.

 I mostly use for office purposes: email, word, excel, research on web and posting on a Wordpress website, a bit of resizing pictures or joining videos, but not much.
 I like touch screen Windows but it sounds like Mac is more durable and more smooth? I have an iPhone so it’s convenient to use with Mac but it’s just a 6s I got for free. What I don’t like about recent Mac is the USB port.
 So what do you guys use? MacBook/Windows/Linux and how’s your experience? Anyone use surface? Anyone use iPad with keyboard instead of a laptop?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I recently came back from a 4 month trip in Vietnam where I cruised along with hotels and airbnbs. Yes it got slightly out of hand and my budget grew.
 I work remotely and I’ve decided to try living in Vietnam longer term. I have a 5 year visa and I need to exit the country every 6 months which is fine because visit family and friends back home. 
  
 I am figuring out the right visa for me… Even though I can stay in the country for 6 months on a tourist visa. But I’m confused? 
  
I want to rent a high rise serviced apartment with 2 rooms close to the center. Is US$600 per month enough? 
 I don’t plan to party and drink (as much as I did last trip) and I’m more focused on really understanding the motherland. I want it to be more meaningful and I create real, lasting friendships. 
 So I plan to budget US$500-800 for spending money for everything I need per month.
 I’m extremely interested in investing and entrepreneurship here in Vietnam. So I’d like to start a business here. 
 I leave in December again. I’m getting travel insurance etc. visa, passport and everything renewed. 
 Any tips are welcome! Thanks.

 So early next year I am going to visit Vietnam, but I only have 7 days do explore the country. I know, 7 days is nothing in a country such as this.
 I am going to start in Ho Chi Minh, for the first 2 days, then I was thinking of taking an overnight train/bus to start making my way up to Hanoi. 
 Other than Ho Chi Minh, I would like to visit Halong Bay, or Ninh Binh, or maybe both. Then I would like to go up to the Mount Fansipan (highest point), then obviously visit Hanoi too.
 Is this doable? Do you guys have any recommendations for me?
 Thank you so much!
 All the best.

One of the things we do is provide 2 weeks of groceries to help tide them over till benefits and jobs kick in. Sometimes our volunteers provide the groceries. Sometimes people give us money and we do a grocery pickup for the case worker. 
 Will you help me create a list of basics that they may want in their kitchen? Keep in mind that the food is limited in Walmart - for example, I can't get rice noodles most of the time, so food that can be substituted is important. They will have nothing in their kitchens and we can't provide everything so knowing what foods are more common/used more is better than having a big variety of things. Meats, grains, produce spices, condiments, etc.

 Souvenirs, hotels, food, vehicle, experiences, anything goes! A good story for the grandkids later.
 This is a lot of money for me, so by no means do i mean to waste 100 dollars on shots or something. What would you do given the same condition?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see many myths perpetuated both here and in daily life. This happens with all languages (see endless arguments on YouTube about Tamil/Sanskrit/Chinese being 'the oldest language', a nonsensical notion).
 Some typical myths:
 - Vietnamese grammar is 'backwards' compared to English/other language of choice (or just difficult in general)
 - Vietnamese has many words/syllables/etc. with different meanings (making it difficult)
 - The Vietnamese writing system is difficult and 'needs' to be reformed
 Just off the top of my head, I have seen and heard these three very recently. If I sat down and thought/researched I could list many more.
 The problem is that none of these claims mean anything in isolation. Many words with different meanings---compared to what language? Difficult writing system---compared to what other writing systems? And where's the evidence? There is never or very rarely any evidence or standards of comparison given. As a linguist I could go into detail on these issues, but I'd rather see what other people have to say first.
 Now flame me and tell me why I'm wrong.

I was born in Vietnam but left at a very young age and a dual citizen of both countries. I've made the stupid mistake of applying for an ID which means now that my name is in the system and they've just called me up for a health checkup tomorrow for conscription in 2023 as I'm 23yo and the age of conscription is until you're 27 (as I've recently found out).
 Has anyone been through this before? Is there any way to get out of this since I'm a dual citizen or would I have to leave the country ASAP, I did enter on my Vietnamese Passport. My mum is convinced if they conscript me I'll lose my Australian citizenship.
 I'd really appreciate some advice or if anyone could recommend me a good lawyer in Hanoi regarding this matter, thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! 
 Anyone knows what are the requirements for an American citizen and a Vietnamese citizen to get married and apply for the Vietnam 5-year visa exemption certificate? 
 Especially, any income or jobs requirements if we want to live in Vietnam for around 5 years? I assume the Vietnamese spouse has to earn a certain amount of income to sponsor the American spouse. 
 Any advices and personal experiences are greatly appreciate! Just wanna get a general idea of what we will need to deal with :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Would love to know what are thoughts from different age groups of Vietnam locals about developing advanced economy, despite all the problems mentioned in different industry articles.
 My core part at work is a radical shift in commerce / production & supply chains with innovating incentives for companies, employees and end customers / consumers that adopts to clean tech driven supply chains; be it food, healthcare, renewables, electronics, FMCG, sales through new B2B, B2C channels, services, EVs etc.
 I personally love the creative designs from Vietnam that uses natural biofibers (bamboo, hyacinth etc.) & overall designs. They are at par with details from Japanese, Chinese, Thailand's creative arts - a mix of tradition, nature & modern.
 I also got surprised by recent developments & announcements by Vingroup EV making in US for US customers. & at the same time, I wonder why MSMEs (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises) of Vietnam are not gearing up faster at global stage. 
 For example, I never see them at industrial trade shows of the West (US, EU) or even at the East (digital or physical attendance), even though products are pretty good & innovative. Lets say Amazon SEA summit in Singapore, there are zero Vietnamese companies / MSMEs.
 Few of them are on Alibaba, but finding other MSMEs is hard as Alibaba is not that connected with new development outside of China, and the restrictions etc. makes it more complicated. 
 Also, few good points from my research are repeated in this article: on Vietnam + ASEAN region since most of our suppliers at work are looking at ASEAN countries for shifting their production from China.

She said they usually call the recipient to pick it up and if they don't respond, they cant deliver the package?? The site didn't let me put a phone number in so idk how tf thats gonna work lol 
 If they can't contact the recipient do they just take it back to the post office and she would have to pick it up herself?

I do not plan to have a checked bag for this particular domestic flight and just travel with a carry-on. But, I have quite a bit of toiletries items that exceed the US TSA liquid rule. Do the Vietnam domestic flight have a rule on liquid in carry-on? Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, so I’m learning about Vietnam for my French class right now and we’re discussing the “Boat People” or the refugees who fled the country after the end of the war in ‘75. So this to me seems a bit sketchy (I identify as between socialist and ML). Who were the people that fled, just former bureaucrats for the south and sympathizers, or just your average Joe. What were the education centres? Disguised prisons or actual places where people learned about socialism? Overall, is it justified in calling Vietnam authoritarian post war and were the people justly fleeing the nation, or was it just propaganda and actual crimes of those who fled that caused the exodus

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, not trying to be rude with this question, just genuinely curious. I have a lot of friends in Vietnam, and whenever I look at their pictures, or pics of their friends, or even just random Vietnamese people, they all wear Gucci and Chloe and Supreme branded shirts and shoes (I know it's all fake, because like, my guy, the floor of your home is dirt) but it's curious to me. Why go for the luxury brand stuff so much? I dont even know that many Americans into this stuff but like every Vietnamese person I see is in Balenciaga tshirts with Louis Vuitton Air Jordans on. Especially since we all know it's counterfeit. What's the point?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi there im a 21 year old from the bay area, ca. i'm pretty cut off from my heritage, and i'm trying to research more about any kind of scene or punk bands in vietnam as a means to feel closer.
 from what i understand, any kind of scene is pretty minimal at the moment but there was some activity back in the 1990's/2010's. i've heard saigon and hanoi come up a lot as culture hot spots, but what is it like now? are there any memorable bands worth mentioning? is there an alternative scene in vietnam at all and what does it look like?
 i've discovered gỗlim (https://open.spotify.com/track/35WT2fGUfzi7GwKVUSR2pG?si=gPaZnkvGQHepWxtrf_HyUw&utm_source=copy-link), and i've also stumbled across 7uppercut, đá sối tội, and mona evie.
 thank you :-) ❤️

 I went to the police station nearest to the cinema, I had to Google translate and I got told to go to another police station. When I got to the other police station, the guy flat out refused to file a report for me which annoyed me.
 I’m at my wits ends I don’t know what to do. Can I apply for a new passport at the embassy without A police report?

 We are a couple from India who would be travelling to Hanoi in December, we are excited to be there!!
 We have a few questions -
  
We are trying to get tickets from Hanoi to India back, but VietJet Air seems to be rejecting our tickets, also the flights are not showing up on its website! Is there a problem with it? 
 
What should we do about the accommodations while in Vietnam, we have budget for 4 star hotels but some fellow travellers told us getting AirBnbs would be a lot better. What do you suggest?
 
We have a 6 day trip, what all places do you suggest we visit?
 
 Thanks in advance!!

 We all hold british passports so would be able to enter for 14 days with just proof of a flight out of Vietnam and then extend this whilst there?

 On their website:
 https://ten-pac.com/direct-billing-is-great-but-not-perfect-for-everything/?utm_source=social+media&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=blog-directbilling
 they have a graphic and it says direct billing 'eliminates paperwork'...but then below that it says direct billing is useful but can have drawbacks. It goes on to say:
  
One reality most people aren’t aware of is that many medical providers charge more if you have insurance. They do this because they don’t have the additional costs of administering insurance billing and payments...
  
Surely, if the medical provider do NOT have the additional cost of administering billing and payments then the bill will be LESS not MORE?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I am visiting Northern Vietnam this week. I am looking for tips, recommendations and any warnings that I can make use. 
 I am landing in Hanoi. And planned to take the cruise for Ha Lon Bay. But I don’t have any plans for almost a week. 
 I plan to do local sightseeing and also shopping. I want to buy local stuff and hopefully within budget. 
 I plan to travel a couple of places near Ha Noi where I can go for day tours but not sure yet
 I have already been to Saigon few months ago. 
 Looking for help from you guys. 
 TIA

 I have a week early December to spend in either Thailand or Vietnam.
 Has anyone been to both and can share experiences and what their favourite was and why?
 About me: I am 29(F). I don’t enjoy kicking back and relaxing on holidays (I know these places are good for that but not why I’d go) - I want to see interesting things, go on hikes, see beautiful landscapes and learn about culture and history.
 Appreciate your help! :)

She is much older and not good with technology so PayPal and those kinds of apps are not ideal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am sure that this type of question is posted and reposted multiple times around this time of year, so I apologize if I am being redundant. I searched Tet in the sub history and did not see many things regarding the questions I have.
 Firstly, my girlfriend and I are interested in traveling to Vietnam during Tet as it seems like a joyous way to celebrate the new year. Here in the US there are group activities such as bars to go to and fire work shows. We looked at cities and dates, and have thought about spending the month of January from beginning to end in Hoi An.
 I understand we may be behaving as ignorant Americans, thinking that everything will be open or that there will be mass celebrations. But we really just want to experience the culture. Is it possible -post Covid- to do this somewhere in Vietnam? Neither of us wish to be disrespectful to your country. We are realistic travelers, we know to go with the flow and are ok with buying food to make our own meals. We do NOT expect to be catered to or waited on. We want to enjoy your beautiful culture.
 Is Hoi An truly a good city for this type of thing, or should we go to Ho Chi Minh city?
 If it is possible to join a city in celebration of Tet, how should we go about this while being respectful?
 Thank you for taking the time to read this, I wish you the best.
 ​
 EDIT: Thank you all for your responses. I see I did misunderstand the nature of Tet. It seems it would be better for my girlfriend and I to visit during a different time year. I appreciate you all. We will look for somewhere else to visit.

 I'm going to central Vietnam (Da Nang, Hoi an, Hue) in a couple days. 
 It's gonna be a short trip. We'll arrive on Monday evening and leave Saturday morning (so about 5.5 days in Vietnam?)
 So my question is, how much should I budget for this? I don't have fancy tastes or require luxurious hotels.
 And also, what's the best way to get my Dong?
 Its probably gonna be the most convenient to exchange my money at the airport but I've heard the rates aren't so good...

 About our backgrounds: Me, vietnamese, i've been working in Germany as a nurse since 2018 My fiancé, german, currently working for an enery provider.
 It'd be helpful, if anyone could give us some insights. About what we should prepare, before we make the move. Maybe someone who has recently moved there. What should we pay attention to? How is life going on for you guys in Đà Nẵng or anywhere else in Việt Nam?
 About visa: should we first register our marriage in Germany, so my fiancé can get the 5 years visa?
 We want to prepare and inform ourself before the we make the big decision. We would be thankful for any tips or resources from you guys.
 Why i am a vietnamese and i still need to ask? Because i can't possibly know everything, what my fiancé should prepare, etc ...if we should first get married in Germany, if it gives him any advantage about visa.

Not to mention he has body odor, bad feet and smelly shoes which is quite annoying to me. He disrespected me in our first dating. I don't need someone who is too handsome, I just need to dress neatly and cleanly
 After that meeting, he suggested we become lovers :))), of course I refused and just wanted to stay friends but he kept bothering me, so I blocked him and no more contact. 
 As a Vietnamese myself, I get annoyed when other people ask about my salary. I don't know if it's normal to ask about salary in the first meeting for foreigners?

I've been researching itineraries online and on this subreddit but there's a lot of information out there. It makes me feel a little overwhelmed and unprepared.
 I have some places in mind that I'd like to visit and have drawn up a rough timeline. I'm pretty flexible so your input and any useful information/advice would be much appreciated. I've opted for 3 nights in Hanoi as I arrive late evening. My timeline is as follows:
 Hanoi: 3 nights Sapa: 2 nights Ha Giang loop: 3 nights Halong bay: 2 nights Ninh Binh: 2 nights Vinh: 2 nights Hue: 2 nights Hoi An: 3 nights Nha Trang: 2 nights Dalat: 2 nights Mui Ne: 2 nights Ho Chi Minh: 3 nights Phu Quoc: 2 nights (Optional)
 Thank you, cam on!

 She is first-generation Vietnamese American, so she will go by an English (Christian) name throughout the story, but she still needs a Vietnamese given name and family name. 
 The English name I'd want to give to her is Trinity -- so "Trinh" would be perfect, but I'm not sure if that'd sound weird if used as a first name. Any other ideas? I'm not super committed to "Trinity," but I'd like there to be some connection between her given name and English name.
 I also need a family name. I know "Nguyen" is the stereotypical one, but if you were reading a book with a Vietnamese main character, what other names would sound normal and natural to you?

 When they show me the translation (Vietnamese to English), I can understand what they mean, but when it's my turn to type something, they often look confused when they see the translation provided by Google Translate. 
 It makes me wonder, is the app accurate when it comes to translating English into Vietnamese? It seems to be ok the other way around.

I have looked at offers for day trips on various sites and they all say the same and very touristy. It seems like you are driven from shop to shop to buy coconut sweets, honey and chocolate and then see a show of people playing "traditional" music for you. Maybe I'm being too sceptical and it's not a touristy mall after all, but maybe someone here has experience with this.
 Are there perhaps other providers who offer tours on less beaten paths? I am grateful for any tips.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello y'all, I'm a female solo traveler planning to go to Vietnam (and also Cambodia) for a backpacking trip. I'm planning to visit the country south to north (mostly focusing on the north) , and I'd like to stay in Vietnam for 25 days (I'll dedicate either 4-5 days to Cambodia, just checking out to the capital and Angkor Wat). Is that enough or too much time? My main interest are nature, and history. I don't really care about hitting the beach, and partying is okay but not like a must. My itinerary is Ho chi Minh - flight to Hoi an - Hue - Phong Nha - Tom Coc (ninh binh) - Hanoi - cruise to Ha long Bay - Ha Giang Loop . Is there anything that i'm missing?
 I'm planning to be there at the end of February, March (i'll definitely be in the north during march). Is that a good time to visit? Can I book everything once I'm already there such as accommodation/flights to have some extra flexibility, or is it high season and I'd probably book everything ahead to avoid shitty hostels and expensive flights?
 Should I bother going to Sapa or is it too cold/foggy in March, and not worth it?
 How is it safety wise? Are night buses safe, do they drop you in the middle of nowhere or you can ask them to drop you close to your accommodation? I'm not thrilled about potentially walking alone at night with a huge backpack. Can you as tourist (i'm a skinny white girl there is no way I'll pass for a Vietnamese) walk safely at night alone ? Is taking taxis/tuk tuk alone at night safe (i've lived in south america, heard way too many horror stories)?
 Thanks for all the help :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I have been reading a lot about ethnic, mountainous groups in rural settings of Vietnam. I came across the Chut ethnic group located in eastern Laos and in Quang Binh province and I’ve have been trying to find information on their religious beliefs and specific cultural idiosyncrasies that separate them from or align them with other ethnic practices in Vietnam. I suppose I am more trying to find out more about their “religious” practices, primarily relating to death and funeral processions. I can’t find anything. 
 Do they practice a generally “animist” belief system pertaining to the afterlife, spirits, etc? I know commonly in animist belief structure, there is this idea of the wandering soul, in that unnatural or untimely or violent death can result in malevolent spirits that cause turmoil for those around. Is this pertinent among any of the 5 subgroups (ruc, May, etc) under the Chut umbrella? 
 Thanks for any input

 Today, my MIL was telling me that she's very concerned because she follows a guy (singer? monk?) on YouTube, who is famous for raising five orphans. This is the Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/thienambenbovutru9. Apparently the guy is in jail because he's been accused of having sex with the kids, but he's claiming innocence and asking people to sign a petition for him.
 Does anyone know about this? Is this some kind of famous case? And if so, how can my MIL sign the petition for him?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm just planning a trip for next year.
 And as part of the trip I want to mention an apartment in the area of ​​District 1.
 My only problem is calculating a budget for the trip.
 How much money do you think you need per month? For a good apartment.. and to eat every day in a restaurant?
 Because I understood that your country is very cheap.
 1500 dollars per month should be enough?
 sorry for the english
 I use automatic translation so it's not that good
